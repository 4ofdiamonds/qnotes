- Life requires ~25 chemicals
- **4 essential (96%):** 
	- **Carbon**
	- **Hydrogen**
	- **Oxygen**
	- **Nitrogen**
- **4 remaining (4%)**
	- **phosphorus**
	- **calcium**
	- **sulfur**
	- **potassium**
- Bonding is important because they allow for energy storage and structure creation
- Valency is important because it allows for [[oxidation and reduction]] of oxygen to $H_2O$ and sulfur to $H_2S$
- Water is extremely polar which means that it has lots of hydrogen bonding
- **Properties of Water**
	- **All life occurs in water, both inside and outside the cell**
	- **Cohesion and Adhesion**
		- Cohesion
			- Hydrogen bonding between other water molecules
			- Has high surface tension
		- Adhesion
			- Hydrogen bonding between water and other surfaces
			- Capillary action
			- Meniscus
		- Both these actions are how water is able to get to the top of trees
	- **Good Solvent**
		- Solvents dissolve Solutes creating solutions
		- Water is highly polar which means it can dissolve other polar molecules such as + and - Ions
	- **Lower Density as solid**
		- Hydrogen bonds are less stable in liquid water has hydrogen bonds constantly reforming while ice has more stable hydrogen bonds which makes it float
		- The ice floating on the surface of lakes insulates the bottom
		- If it sank the entire lake would completely freeze over
		- Sinking $H_{2}O$ is responsible for cycling nutrients
	- High specific heat capacity **[[Specific Heat Capacity]]**
		- Water is able to moderate the temperature of earth
		- Requires lots of time to absorb and release heat
	- **High heat of vaporization**
		- High heat of vaporization means it takes a lot of heat energy with it as it evaporates
- Ionization of water and pH
	- Water ionizes, $H^+$ and $OH-$ split off from $H_2O$
	- Cells like to stay at a pH of 7
		- pH affects molecule shape
		- shape affects function
		- pH affects function
	- pH change from external factors can be resisted by buffers
	- buffers are molecules that either donates or absorbs $H+$ when levels fall or rise
