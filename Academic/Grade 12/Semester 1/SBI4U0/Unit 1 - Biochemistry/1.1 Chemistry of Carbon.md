//////////## Chemistry of Life
- [[1.0 Intro|Cells are made of]]
	- **~72% $H_{2}O$**
	- **~25% carbon compounds**
		- **Carbohydrates**
		- **Lipids**
		- **Proteins**
		- **Nucleic Acids**
	- **~3% salts**
		- **Na, Cl, K**
## Organic Chemistry
- Carbon atoms are versatile due to 4 stable covalent bonds
	- ==Hydrocarbons are made of Carbon & Hydrogen==
		- They structures are non-polar which are ==hydrophobic==
	- They are stable and have very little attraction between molecules
		- Most are gas at room temperature
	- Isomers are the same chemical compounds just a different arrangements
		- These structure changes can affect the function
### Functional Groups
- Atoms can be substituted to create different molecules are generally with different [[Functional Groups]] which are parts of organic molecules that are involved in chemical reaction
		- **Hydroxyl**
			- **$-OH$**
			- **ends with -ol**
		- **Carbonyl**
			- **$C=O$**
			- **Located at the end: Aldehyde**
			- **Located in the middle: Ketone**
		- **Carboxyl**
			- **$-COOH$**
			- **compounds become acids**
		- **Amino**
			- **$NH_{2}$**
			- **amines**
			- **$NH_{2}$ acts as a base and can pick up $H+$ from a solution**
		- **Sulfhydryl**
			- **$-SH$**
			- **thiols**
			- **stabilizes protein structures**
		- **Phosphate**
			- **$-PO_{4}$**
			- **connects to a Carbon through an O**
			- **lots of negative charge which is highly reactive**
	- Functional groups make hydrocarbons more reactive and soluble in water
### Macromolecules
- [[1.2 Carbohydrates|Carbohydrates]]
- [[1.3 Lipids|Lipids]]
- [[1.4 Proteins|Proteins]]
- [[1.5 Nucleic Acids|Nucleic Acids]]
- Polymers
	- Long chains of repeating building blocks
	- Monomers are the subunit that make up polymers
	- **Covalent bonds that are generally formed by dehydration synthesis**
		- **Dehydration Synthesis takes place when one monomer donates $OH^-$ and the other donates $H^+$ forming $H_{2}O$**
		- **Dehydration synthesis requires energy and [[2.0 Enzymes|Enzymes]]**
	- **Hydrolysis is the inverse of dehydration synthesis and uses up $H_{2}O$ to cleave one monomer**
		- **Hydrolysis requires [[2.0 Enzymes|Enzymes]] and releases energy**
