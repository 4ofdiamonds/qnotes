## Carbohydrates
- Carbohydrates are made of C, H, and O
- **General Formula: $(CH_{2}O)_{x}$**
- Functions:
	- energy $\rightarrow$ energy storage
	- raw materials $\rightarrow$ structural materials
		- Can be used in monomers
## Sugars
- Structure
	- Most carbohydrates are sugars that end in -ose
	- Sugars generally have H and OH bonds for each carbon in the chain
	- Classified by the amount of carbons
		- **6C = hexose**
		- **5C = pentose**
		- **3C = triose**
	- The different functional groups determine the function
		- **Aldehyde = Aldoses**
		- **Ketones = Ketoses**
	- Carbohydrates normally turn into ring structures when dissolved in water
	- Normally the first carbon bonds with the $OH$ connected to the carbon before the terminal
	- Energy is stored between the $C-C$ bonds
- Simple vs Complex sugars
	- **Monosaccharides = 1 Monomer (glucose)**
	- **Disaccharides = 2 Monomers (sucrose)**
	- **Polysaccharides = Large Polymers (starch)**
- Building Sugars
	- Sugars are created by [[Polymerization|polymerizing]] through dehydration synthesis two sugars together to create a ==glycosidic linkage==
	- These Polysaccharides take ==very little energy to build and are easily reversible==
	- Function
		- **Energy storage**
			- **Starch (Plants)**
			- **Glycogen (Animals)**
		- **Structure**
			- **Cellulose (Plants)**
			- **Chitin (Arthropods & Fungi)**
	- Starch in plants is stored in long linear chains while Glycogen is stored in branching chains which is easier for fast release because they can be catalyzed in multiple spots at once
	- The difference between these polysaccharide function are the isomers of glucose used
		- $\alpha$ glucose with 1-4 carbon linkage is used in starch and energy storage
		- $\beta$ glucose with 1-4 carbon linkage which alternate in direction is used in cellulose and is harder to digest because it requires alternating [[2.0 Enzymes|Enzymes]] to digest is used in cellulose
			- Cellulose is the most abundant organic compound on earth and most herbivores have developed the ability to but most carnivores have not
			- Herbivores have certain bacteria in their stomach that are able to produce the enzymes needed for digestion
				- Ruminant = Grazing Animals
