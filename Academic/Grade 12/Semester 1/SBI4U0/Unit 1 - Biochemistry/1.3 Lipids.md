## Lipids
- Lipids are composed of C, H, and O
- Their defining characteristic is long hydrocarbon chains that do not form continuous chains
- Family Groups
	- **Fats**
	- **Phospholipids**
	- **Steroids**
### Fats
- Structure
	- Glycerol (3C alcohol) + 3 fatty acid tail
		- Fatty acid = long Hydrocarbon tail with a carboxyl (COOH) group head 
- Building Fats
	- Triacylglycerol
		- ==3 Fatty acids linked to glycerol==
		- ==ester linkage== = formed through dehydration synthesis between an hydroxyl (OH) and carboxyl (COOH) which occurs between the glycerol and the fatty acid
- Function
	- Fats store lots of energy in the long fatty acid which are polar and hydrophobic
	- ==2x as concentrated== as carbohydrate storage
	- Roles: Cushion Organs and Insulate the body
- Classifications:
	- ==Saturated fats, all single bonds==== in the fatty acid tail which results in straight long chains. → ==Solid and room temperature and is found in most animal fats==
	- ==Unsaturated fats, some double bonds== in fatty acids which results in kinks that reduce the concentration. → ==found in most plant and fish oils and liquid at room temperature==
## Phospholipids
- Structure
	- Glycerol + 2 fatty acids + $PO_{4}$
	- Each fatty acid is ester linked to a carbon and the $PO_{4}$ is normally linked. 
- Function
	- The phosphate heads are attracted to water while the tails are hydrophobic towards water
	- When submerged in water they form ==micelles== which are bubbles with hydrophilic heads on the outside and hydrophobic tails on the inside
	- Phospholipids can create a ==double layer which is the main part of the cell membrane==
## Steroids
- Structure
	- ==4 fused carbon rings + functional groups==
	- Different structures create different structures
- Cholesterol
	- ==Important part of the cell membrane==
	- ==The precursor to all other steroids==
	- Helps to make the cell membrane more flexible
