## Proteins
- Most structurally and functionally diverse group
	- **enzymes**
	- **structure**
	- **carriers and transport**
	- **cell communication**
		- **signals**
		- **receptors**
	- **defense**
	- **movement**
	- **storage**
- Structure
	- The ==monomer of proteins are the 20 different amino acids==. Together they form a polypeptide which is twisted and folded into a complex 3-D shape which is the protein
### Amino Acids
- Structure
	- **Central Carbon Group**
	- **Amino Group**
	- **Carboxyl Group**
	- **R Group**
		- The different in amino acids are the 20 different
		- Each R group can be different and they contribute to a different function in the polypeptide:
			- Polar or Non Polar
			- Acidic or Basic
	- Disulfide Bridges
		- $H-S-S-H$
		- Sulfur amino acids can create bridges between the polypeptide which will stabilize the 3-D structure
		- Chaperonin proteins are 
- Building Proteins
	- A peptide bond is formed through dehydration synthesis between the carboxyl and amino groups
	- This creates directionality within the chain with an ==N-terminus and C-terminus==. This creates a $N-C-C$ chain
	- ==Chaperonin proteins== aid in the folding polypeptides but inserting the polypeptide into a hollow cylinder an adding a protein cap on top
- 3-D Structure and Function
	- Structure
		- Primary Structure
			- ==Amino Acid Sequence==
			- Slight sequence changes can have massive impacts on function
		- Secondary Structure
			- ==Local Folding== of the polypeptide chain due to ==hydrogen bonding== between the R groups.
			- $\alpha$-helix and $\beta$-pleated sheet
		- Tertiary Structure
			- Interactions between ==distance amino acid== due to ==hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions with cytoplasm, Hydrogen Bonding and Disulfide bridges==
		- Quaternary Structure
			- Multiple polypeptide chains that are bonded together
			- Hydrophobic Interactions
	- Denaturation
		- Under certain conditions proteins the ==secondary and tertiary structure== start to unfold.
			- **H Bonds**
			- **Ionic bonds**
			- **Disulfide bridges**
		- This can be due to:
			- **Temperature**
			- **pH**
			- **Salinity**
