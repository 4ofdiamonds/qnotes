## Nucleic Acids
- Function:
	- Stores genetic information which are the blueprint for building proteins
	- Transfers information through duplication to new cells
- Structure:
	- RNA (ribonucleic acid) = ==single helix==
	- DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) = ==double helix==
	- Monomer = nucleotides
## Nucleotides
- Structure: 
	- **Nitrogen Base ($C-N$ ring)**
		- **Purines = double ring N base**
			- **Adenine**
			- **Guanine**
		- **Pyrimidines = single ring N base**
			- **Cytosine**
			- **Thymine**
			- **Uracil**
	- **Pentose Sugar (5C ring)**
		- **Ribose in RNA**
		- **Deoxyribose in DNA**
	- **Phosphate ($PO_{4}$) group**
- Nucleic Polymer
	- The backbone is formed by Sugar to $PO_{4}$ bonds through a ==phosphodiester bond==
	- New bases are added to the ==sugar of the previous base==. This means polymers can only grow in the phosphate direction
	- The Nitrogenous bases hang off the sugar phosphate backbone
- Pairing of Nucleotides
	- Nucleotides hydrogen bond between strands
		- **Purines $-$ Pyrimidines**
		- **A $-$ T = 2 H bonds**
		- **G $-$ C = 3 H bonds**
	- During replication the two DNA strands are ==complementary== which means they can both replicate and retain information
	- The ==ratio of A-T:G-C affects the stability== of the DNA molecule due to the difference in hydrogen bonds
	- High Temperature organisms have more ==G-C (3H bonds)==
	- Parasites have many ==A-T (2H bonds)==
- ATP
	- Adenosine Triphosphate is the ==Adenosine nucleotide with the addition of two phosphate groups==
