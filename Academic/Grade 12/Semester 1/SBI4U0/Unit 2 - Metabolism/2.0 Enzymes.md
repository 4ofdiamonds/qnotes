## Metabolism
- Chemical Reactions of life
	- **Forming bonds (Anabolic Reactions)**
		- Dehydration Synthesis
		- Synthesis
		- Exergonic (release of energy)
	- **Breaking Bonds (Catabolic Reactions)**
		- Hydrolysis
		- Digestion
		- Endergonic (input of energy)
	- **Gibbs Free Energy ($\Delta G$)**
		- The difference in energy of the products and the reactants
		- Exergonic means that $\Delta G$ = -
		- Endergonic means that $\Delta G$ = +
	- Organisms will ==couple exergonic reaction and endergonic reactions== to make these life sustaining reactions possible
- Activation Energy
	- Starting these reactions requires an initial input of energy which is why reactions are controlled and slow
	- Normally bonds are stable and require too much energy to destabilize but catalysts (enzymes) are able to reduce the initial activation energy
## Enzymes
- Enzymes are ==highly specific== [[1.4 Proteins|proteins]] or RNA that facilitate chemical reactions
- Enzymes ==increase the [[rate of reaction|rate of reaction]]== and ==reduce activation energy without being consumed== in the reaction
- Enzyme Vocabulary
	- **Substrate**: Reactants which bind to the enzyme
	- **Product**: The end result
	- **Active Site**: The place where the substrate fits into
- Properties
	- **Reaction Specific**: Binds through H bonds and ionic bonds to catalyze a specific reaction
	- **Not Consumed in the reaction**: Catalyzes thousands of reactions per second
	- **Affected by cellular conditions**: Like [[1.4 Proteins|Proteins]] they are affected by temperature, pH, and salinity
- Naming
	- generally end is -ase
	- Examples:
		- Sucrase (breakdown sucrose)
		- Proteases (breakdown proteins)
		- lipases (breakdown lipids)
		- [[4.1 DNA replication|DNA polymerase]] (builds DNA)
- Structure
	- **Lock and Key model**
		- Substrate fits precisely in through H bonds and is locked into the active site
	- **Induced Fit mode**
		- ==More accurate model==
		- The substrate binds to the active site and changes the shape of the enzyme to fit tighter. (==Conformational change==)
- Functionality
	- **Synthesis**
		- Orients substrates in the correct position for them to react
	- **Digestion**
		- Stresses the bonds in the substrates for them to be broken
## Factors that Affect Enzymes
- Factors
	- **Enzymes Concentration**
		- ==as ↑ enzyme = ↑ reaction rate==
		- Reaction rates increase because there are more frequent collisions with substrates
		- Reaction rate will level off after a certain point due to substrate concentration becoming the limiting factor
	- **Substrate Concentration**
		- ==as ↑ substrate = ↑ reaction rate==
		- Reaction rates increase because there are more frequent collisions with enzymes
		- Reaction rate will level off after a certain point due to enzyme concentration becoming the limiting factor
	- **Temperature**
		- In temperature there is an Optimum $T^{\circ}$ value
		- **Increased temperature** will result in ==denaturation of the enzyme==
		- **Decrease temperature** will result in ==slower reaction speed==
		- Enzymes are created to have different Optimum $T^{\circ}$ values depending on the environment
	- **pH**
		- ==Addition of $H^+$== can disrupt bonds and 3D shape (secondary and tertiary structures) and denature proteins
		- Depending on the environment in the body the optimum pH will change
	- **Salinity**
		- ==Addition of ions== can disrupt bonds and 3D shape (secondary and tertiary structures) and denature proteins
	- **Activators**
		- **Cofactors** are ==inorganic compounds== and ions that are bound to enzyme molecules to help them to work (These are your minerals you get from food)
		- **Coenzymes** are ==organic molecules== which bind to enzymes to help them work (These are your vitamins you get from food)
	- **Inhibitors**
		- **Competitive inhibitors** will compete for the active site of the enzyme and will effectively reduce available enzymes. This can be overcome by ==increasing substrate concentration==
		- **Non-Competitive inhibitors** will bind to a site that is not the active site called the ==allosteric site== which causes ==conformational change== and causes enzyme to no longer function
		- **Irreversible inhibition** either a competitor or allosteric molecule binds to the enzyme which permanently inhibits its the enzyme
		- **Allosteric Regulation** 
			- some enzymes ==start inactive and require activators== to make them work 
			- some enzymes ==start active and require inhibitors== to stop them
		- **Metabolic Pathways**
			- Enzymes are organized within pathways in the membrane sequentially in order to catalyze the same substrate with ==multiple different reactions== in many small steps
			- **Increased Efficiency** due to coupling of endergonic and exergonic reaction
			- **Increase control** due to feedback inhibition where a certain product along the chain will inhibit the first enzyme in the step to prevent the entire metabolic pathway from being activated
