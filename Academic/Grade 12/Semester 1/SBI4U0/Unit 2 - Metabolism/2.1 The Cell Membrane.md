## Membrane
### Lipids
- **The cell membrane** is a bilayer of [[1.3 Lipids|phospholipids]]
	- The bilayer is ==impermeable to polar molecules==
- **Flexibility and Fluidity** is important in the cell membrane
	- **Composition of unsaturated vs saturated** fatty acids in the bilayer affects ==flexibility==
	- **Cholesterol** also acts as a fluidity buffer by increasing it at low temperature and decreasing it at higher temperature
### Proteins
- **The membrane is semi-permeable** due to [[1.4 Proteins|protein]] channels which allow for polar molecules to cross the membrane
	- **Non-Polar amino acids** are hydrophobic and ==anchor the protein== into the membrane
	- **Polar amino acids** are extend into the ==extracellular and intracellular fluid==
- Other Functions
	- Transporter
	- Enzyme Activity
	- Cell Surface Receptor
	- Cell Surface Identity Marker
	- Cell Adhesion
	- Attachment to the cytoskeleton
- Classes of Proteins
	- Peripheral proteins are loosely bound to the surface
	- Integral Proteins are part of the bilayer
### Carbohydrates
- Carbohydrates are located on the cell surface which are responsible for cell to cell recognition
## Movement Across the Membrane
- **Diffusion** is based on the second law of Thermodynamics where systems tend to disorder ==(Always High → Low Concentration)==
- Passive Transport
	- **Simple diffusion (high → low concentration)**
		- No energy is required
		- **Fats and lipids** can move freely
		- **Polar Molecules, Ions, Large molecules** cannot get through
	- **Facilitated Diffusion (high → low concentration)**
		- No energy require
		- Specific molecules can move through the protein
		- Needed to cycle in material and cycle out waste
- Active Transport
	- **Protein Pump**
		- Energy is required
		- Conformational change of the protein is required
		- **Symport** is two materials being transported in ==the same== directions
		- **Antiport** is two materials being transported in ==opposite== direction
- Large molecules
	- **Endocytosis**
		- **Phagocytosis** = cellular eating
		- **Pinocytosis** = cellular drinking
		- **Receptor-mediated endocytosis** = triggered my molecular signal
	- **Exocytosis** = expulsion of waste
- Osmosis
	- Water always diffuses from high concentration → low concentration
	- **Hypertonic** = More solute, less water
	- **Hypotonic** = Less solute, more water
	- **Isotonic** = equal solute, equal water
	- The environment of the cell can cause it to ==shrivel in hypertonic solutions== or ==lyse in hypotonic solutions==
	- Plant cells prefer hypotonic solutions
	- Aquaporins move water in and out of the cell
