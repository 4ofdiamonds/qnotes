## Cells
- Cell have to do many things to stay alive
	- **Make Proteins** as they control every cell function
	- **Create energy** for reactions
	- **Create more cells**
- Energy Creation
	- Cells take in food and $O_{2}$ and create [[2.3 ATP|ATP]] and waste
## Lysosomes
- Function
	- **Digest macromolecules** and **cleans up broken down organelles**
	- Only found in the ==animal cells== and are synthesized by the rough ER and are stored in the Golgi
	-  ==Combines with food vacuoles== to digest macro molecules into monomers
- Lysosomal Enzymes
	- These enzymes work best at ==pH 5==
	- Lysosomes get pumped $H^+$ ions from the cytoplasm to decrease pH value
	- This is a defense mechanism as ==digestive enzymes will denature== if any leak
- Apoptosis
	- Lysosomes kill cells that need to be destroyed
	- Control of cell growth to prevent cancer or structures that inhibit the organisms functions
## Energy Production
- The mitochondria converts ==energy from reactions into ATP== which is the bodies energy currency
	- Glucose → ATP
- Chloroplasts convert energy from the sun into ATP and [[1.2 Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]]
- Similarities between chloroplasts and mitochondria
	- **Generate ATP**
	- **double membrane**
	- **semi-autonomous cells**
	- **internal ribosomes, DNA and enzymes**
### Mitochondria
- $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_{2} \rightarrow 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + ATP$
- Function
	- Create ATP through ==cellular respiration==
	- breakdown of sugars fats in the presence of oxygen
	- generate energy in presence of $O_{2}$ through ==aerobic respiration==
	- Mitochondria concentration is associated with metabolic activity within a cell
- Structure
	- **2 Membranes**
		- Smooth outer membrane
		- Highly folded inner membrane with folded ==cristae==
	- **Fluid** is present in between the 2 membranes
	- **Mitochondrial matrix** is present in the inner membrane which contains DNA ribosomes and enzymes
### Chloroplasts
- $6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + \text{light energy} \rightarrow C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_{2}$
- Function
	- Chloroplasts are a class of plastids in plant cells
		- **Amyloplasts** store starch in roots and tubers
		- **Chromoplasts** store pigments
		- **Chloroplasts** store chlorophyll and are responsible for photosynthesis
	- Chloroplasts use photosynthesis to turn solar energy into chemical energy
- Structure
	- **2 Membranes**
	- **Stroma** is the internal fluid filled space which contains DNA, ribosomes and enzymes
	- **Thylakoids** are the sacs where ATP is produced
	- **Grana** are stacks of thylakoids
### Endosymbiosis
- Mitochondria and Chloroplasts were once free living bacteria and combined with another cell and found to have an evolutionary advantage
## Vacuoles
- Function
	- Only found in plants
	- Storage
		- **Proteins**
		- **Inorganic Molecules**
		- **Metabolic Byproducts**
		- **Pigments**
		- **Defensive compounds against herbivores**
		- **Selective membrane**
## Peroxisomes
- Function
	- Found in both animals and plants
	- **Breakdown** ==fatty acids → sugars==
	- **detoxifies** the cell by breaking down alcohol and other poison
	- **produce hydrogen peroxide** and is broken down by catalase
