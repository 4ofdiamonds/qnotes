## ATP
- Function
	- Organisms are endergonic systems
	- Energy is required for
		- synthesis
		- reproduction
		- movement
		- active transport
		- temperature regulation
	- The only way for [[2.0 Enzymes|energy coupling]] to take place is through an ==energy currency==
	- High energy organic molecules are broken down and the released energy is ==captured by ATP== which can be used elsewhere
- Structure
	- **Adenosine triphosphate** is a modified [[1.5 Nucleic Acids|nucleotide]]
		- $\text{adennine+ribosde+}P_{i}\rightarrow AMP$
		- $AMP+P_{i}\rightarrow ADP$
		- $ADP+P_{i}\rightarrow ATP$
		- adding phosphates is endergonic
- Energy Storage
	- Each phosphate group is more ==difficult to add== then the previous one
	- The 3rd phosphate group is the most difficult to add and it comes off easily and ==releases lots of energy==
	- $ATP\rightarrow ADP$ has a $\Delta G=-7.3\text{kcal/mole}$
	- **Phosphorylation** occurs when the released phosphate is added onto other molecules
		- **Kinase** is the [[2.0 Enzymes|enzyme]] that causes phosphorylation 
		- Adding a phosphate group to a molecule will make it less stable and easier to synthesize
	- Very good at transferring energy but not at storing it
