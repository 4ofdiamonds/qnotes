## Harvesting Stored Energy
- Heterotrophs eat organic molecules for food and raw materials
	- Digesting larger molecules into smaller molecules breaks bonds and ==move electrons around==. 
	- Electrons carry energy with them and when it is ==stored in other bond== it is released as heat or harvested to make ATP
## Redox
- Function
	- In biology electrons are transported through a hydrogen atom because ==free roaming electrons in the body are dangerous==
	- An molecule will become ==oxidized and loose an electron== ($H^+$) and the other will ==gain an electron and become reduced==
- Structure
	- In the reaction $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}+6O_{2}\rightarrow CO_{2}+6H_{2}O+ATP$: 
		- Glucose converts into $CO_{2}$ will become oxidized and looses electrons
		- $6O_{2}$ converts into $6H_{2}O$ and will become reduced
- Cellular Respiration
	- Cellular respiration can be simplified to
		- **Breaking** first the $C-C$ bonds
		- **Stripping** off electrons from the $C-H$ bonds
	- The electrons have been transported to one of the most ==electronegative atoms== $O_{2}$ 
	- This energy transfer to $O_{2}$ can be used to ==synthesized ATP==
	- Electrons can be moved through electron carriers
		- $NAD^+\rightarrow NADH$ 
		- $FAD^{2+}\rightarrow FADH_{2}$
