 ## Evolution
- Glycolysis is the first step in breaking down glucose
- [[1.2 Carbohydrates|Glucose]] (6C) → Pyruvate 2x(3C)
- It is likely the first energy transfer ever evolved as it is the starting point of all cellular respiration
	- Glycolysis is very inefficient at 2 [[2.3 ATP|ATP]] per Glucose
	- Occurs in the cytoplasm
	- Prokaryotes had no organelles
	- Glycolysis requires no oxygen to take place
## Glycolysis
- 10 Reactions
	- **Glucose** (6C) → 2 Pyruvate (3C)
	- **Produces** 4 ATP and 2 NADH
	- **Consumes** 2 ATP
	- **Net Yield**: 2 ATP and 2 NADH
	- **Only Harvests 3.5% of stored energy in glucose**
- Priming
	- **Overview**:
		- **Phosphorylate glucose**
		- **Molecular Rearrangement**
		- **Split Glucose**
	- [[2.0 Enzymes|Kinase]] ATP to glucose
	- Isomerase glucose into fructose
	- Kinase ATP to fructose
	- Aldolase Fructose into DHAP and G3P
	- Isomerase DHAP into G3P
- Energy Harvest
	- **Overview**: 
		- **G3P is oxidized and donates H to reduce NAD to NADH**
		- **G3P donates two ATP per G3P**
	- [[2.4 Redox Reactions|Oxidize G3P and Reduce NAD to form NADH]]
	- Add Phosphate Group to G3P
	- Kinase the phosphate group off G3P onto ADP to create ATP
	- Enolase H2O off of G3P
	- Kinase another phosphate group off G3P
- Substrate level phosphorylation 
	- The phosphate group is attached directly to the G3P and is phosphorylated to the ADP by the catalase
## Anaerobic Respiration
- $NAD^+$ will run out eventually so the cells require another molecule to accept H
- Ethanol Fermentation takes place in bacteria and yeasts
	- Pathway
		- $\text{Pyruvate}\rightarrow \text{ethanol}+CO_{2}$
		- 2 Pyruvate turns into 2 Acetaldehyde and 2 $CO_{2}$
		- 2 Acetaldehyde is reduced by 2NADH and turns into 2 Ethanol
		- The NADH is oxidized and turns back into $NAD^+$
	- Function  
		- This process is irreversible and can even kill the bacteria due to ethanol production
- Lactic Acid Fermentation
	- Pathway
		- 2 Pyruvate → 2 Lactate
		- 2 Pyruvate is reduced by 2NADH and turns into 2 Ethanol
		- The NADH is oxidized and turns back into $NAD^+$
	- Function
		- This process is reversible and once $O_{2}$ is available it will be converted back to pyruvate in the liver
