  ## Pyruvate Oxidation
- If $O_{2}$ is available [[2.5 Glycolysis|pyruvate]] will enter the [[2.2 Cell Parts|mitochondria]]
- Pathway
	- **Overview**: $\text{Pyruvate}\rightarrow \text{acetyl CoA}+CO_{2}$
	- **Yield**: 2x{2C [[1.2 Carbohydrates|Sugar]], [[2.4 Redox Reactions|NADH]], CO2}
	- **3 Step Oxidation Process**
		- Release 2 $CO_{2}$ 
		- Reduces $2NAD^+\rightarrow 2NADH$ 
		- Produces 2 acetyl CoA
	- Here Acetyl CoA enters the Krebs Cycle
## Krebs Cycle
- Also known as the citric acid cycle and takes place in the ==mitochondrial matrix==
- **Yield**: 2x{ATP, 3NADH, FADH$_{2}$, 2CO2}
- Pathway (2x per Acetyl CoA)
	- Acetyl CoA enters the Krebs cycle and synthesizes with a 4C to create citrate
	- $CO_{2}$ and NADH are produced to create a 5C
	- $CO_{2}$ and NADH are produced to create a 4C
	- An ATP is phosphorylated off
	- FADH is produced
	- NADH is produced
	- The 4C combines with Acetyl CoA to repeat the cycle
- All the electron carriers are sent to the
