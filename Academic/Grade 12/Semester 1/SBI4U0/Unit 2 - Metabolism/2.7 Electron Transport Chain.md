## ATP
- [[2.5 Glycolysis|Glycolysis]] → 2ATP
- [[2.6 Pyruvate Oxidation and The Krebs Cycle|Krebs Cycle]] → 2ATP
## Electron Transport Chain
- Structure
	- The electron transport chain is a series of proteins build into the ==inner mitochondrial membrane==
	- Electrons will be transported down the chain to create an $H^+$ gradient and will yield ~36 ATP per glucose
- Pathway
	- Each complex has different ==electron carriers increasing electronegativity== which attracts the electron down the chain
	- **Complex I**: $H^+$ is separated from NADH and is sent into the intermembrane space while the electron travels through the membrane
	- **Complex Q**: FADH$_{2}$ will release one hydrogen across the membrane and the electron will travel down the membrane
	- **Complex II**: The second hydrogen will be sent down the membrane where the electrons travel to complex C
	- **Complex III**: 1/2 O will pull the electron down into the mitochondrial matrix and created $H_{2}O$ 
	- The Hydrogen gradient is now complete and the ==hydrogen will now flow back down ATP synthase== to create ATP
- If oxygen is not present the ETC will be backed up and ATP production will stop
