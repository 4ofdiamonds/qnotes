## Alternatives
- **Carbohydrates**: During [[2.5 Glycolysis|glycolysis]] ==polymers can be hydrolyzed== into glucose and other ==6C sugars can be isomerized== into [[1.2 Carbohydrates|glucose]]
- **Proteins**: [[1.4 Proteins|Proteins]] can be ==hydrolyzed into amino acids== and ==amino acids can be broken down further==
	- **Amino Group** = Waste
	- **Carboxyl Group** = Enters glycolysis or Krebs cycle at certain stages
- **Fats**: [[1.3 Lipids|Fats]] can be ==hydrolyzed into glycerol and fatty acids==
	- **Glycerol (3C)** = G3P → glycolysis 
	- **Fatty Acids** = 2C acetyl groups → acetyl CoA → [[2.6 Pyruvate Oxidation and The Krebs Cycle|Krebs cycle]]
	- Fats generates 2x more [[2.3 ATP|ATP]] compared to carbohydrates due to more carbon in fat and more oxygen in carbohydrates
## Metabolic Pathways
- The metabolic pathways for both digestion and synthesis can be ==regulated by regulating the [[2.0 Enzymes|enzymes]]== in the pathways
	- **Raw** materials stimulate production
	- **Products inhibit** production
- **Digestion**
	- **Catabolism** when organism needs ==energy or needs raw materials==
	- All macromolecules are digested through the same pathways but ==enter at different parts==
- **Synthesis**
	- **Anabolism** when organism has enough ==energy & a supply of raw materials==
	- The pathways run backwards for the production of macromolecules
		- pyruvate → glucose
		- Krebs Cycle → amino acids
		- acetyl CoA → fatty acids
	- **Acetyl CoA** is the central part for both ==synthesis of fats and production of ATP==
### Regulation
- It is important for regulation to take place to avoid creating unnecessary enzymes and materials or catabolizing too many materials and running out of energy
