## Homeostasis
- **Homeostasis**: The process by which a stable internal environment is maintained despite changes in the external environment.
- Variables that determine homeostasis
	- **Blood sugar**
	- **Fluid Balance**
	- **Body Temperature**
	- **Oxygen Levels**
	- **Blood Pressure**
	- **pH**
- Components of homeostatic control
	- **Monitor**: the ability to detect changes and sends it to the coordinating center
	- **Coordinating Centre**: Receives a message from the monitor and creates a response through a regulator
	- **Regulator**: carries out the response initiated by the coordinating center to maintain homeostasis 
- **The hypothalamus** is the part of the brain that serves as the coordinating center and receives messages from nerves and initiates hormonal response in the pituitary gland
- **The pituitary gland** is the master gland and secretes tropic [[1.3 Lipids|hormones]] that regulate other glands in the body
## Regulation and Communication
- **Endocrine System**
	- System of ductless glands that ==secretes chemical signals== to target receptor [[1.4 Proteins|proteins]] on cells which will have a long lasting, ==slow response==
- **Nervous System** 
	- Transmit electrical signals through nerves and release ==neurotransmitters== which are fast and ==short lasting responses==
- **Dynamic Equilibrium** is achieves through negative and positive feedback
	- **Negative feedback**:
		- When a change of conditions are detected, the response will be to reverse the changes
## Thermoregulation
- Average human body temperature is 37
- **Thermoregulation** is the maintenance of an ideal body temperature which prevents proteins and [[2.0 Enzymes|enzymes]] from denaturing
	- Response to heat stress
		- **Coordinating center** = Hypothalamus
		- **Response** = Skin blood vessels will dilate and sweat glands will activate
	- Response to cold stress
		- **Coordinating center** = Hypothalamus
		- **Response** = Skin blood vessels will constrict and muscles will vibrate
## Countercurrent Exchange
- Occurs when arteries and veins run close to each other in order to maintain temperature neutrality
