## Regulation
- **Hormones** act as chemical messengers and allow the [[3.0 Thermoregulation|body to communicate]] and coordinate
	- Solute Levels in blood
	- Metabolism
	- Growth
	- Development
	- Maturation
	- Reproduction
- **Neurotransmitters** are released by neurons
- **Hormones** are released by endocrine glands
	- [[1.4 Proteins|Protein]] Based Hormones
		- Structure
			- **Polypeptides** small proteins
			- **Glycoproteins** are large proteins + carbohydrates
			- **Amines** are modified amino acids
		- Function
			- **Hydrophilic** and not lipid soluble and are unable to cross the membrane
			- Bind to receptor proteins on the cell membrane and trigger secondary messengers
			- **Turn on genes**
	- [[1.3 Lipids|Lipids]] Based Hormones
		- Structure
			- **Steroids** modified cholesterol
		- Function
			- **Hydrophobic** and lipid soluble which means they can diffuse across the membrane
			- Bind to receptor proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleus
			- Bind to DNA and act as transcription factors
			- **enzyme action, uptake or secretion of molecules**
- **2$^\circ$ messenger system** is able to amplify the messengers signal with multiple secondary messengers
## Positive Feedback Loop
- Occurs to reinforce the change that is temporarily occurring

## Major Glands
- **thyroid** controls metabolic function
- **parathyroid** regulates the calcium, phosphorus and magnesium levels in the blood
- **pituitary** is the master gland and controls growth, metabolism, and reproduction
- **adrenal** secretes and controls stress hormones
- **pineal** is responsible for the night and day secretion of enzymes particularly melatonin
- **ovaries** produce estrogen and control the menstrual cycle 
- **testes** produces testosterone and controls the
