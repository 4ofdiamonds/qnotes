## Energy
- Energy within the body is on a budget and it has priorities
	- **ATP production**
	- **Synthesis**
	- **Storage**
- **Positive Calorie Intake**: In Humans energy is stored in glycogen or as fat if glycogen stores are full
- **Negative Calorie intake**: breakdown glycogen and then breakdown fat
## Blood Sugar
- All mammals must regulate the use and storage of glucose
- The pancreas can secrete two different hormones
	- **Insulin** reduces blood glucose levels by telling liver and muscle cells to store glucose thereby reducing glucose levels
	- **Glucagon** increases blood glucose levels by telling liver and muscle cells breakdown glycogen and release glucose into the blood
- Blood Sugar levels
	- **Hypoglycemia** low sugar
	- **Normal Level** normal sugar
	- **Hyperglycemia** high sugar
## Diabetes
- **Normal**
	- Insulin binds to insulin receptor and triggers the intake of glucose into the cells
- **Type I**
	- Insulin is not produced by beta cells and glucose is not removed from the bloodstream
	- Treatment: Insulin injection
- **Type II**
	- Prolonged production of insulin leads to desensitization of insulin and even when insulin is present the cells do not intake glucose
	- Treatment: Control of dietary intake
