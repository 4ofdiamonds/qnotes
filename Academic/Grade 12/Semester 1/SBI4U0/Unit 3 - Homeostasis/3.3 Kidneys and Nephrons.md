## Evolution
- Animals evolved to support multicellular life and as a byproduct they needed a system that would solve the issue of diffusion not being fast enough
	- **Circulatory System** for distributing nutrients
	- **Excretory System** for excreting waste
- **Osmoregulation**: Water balance vs Habitat
	- Freshwater
		- Hypotonic to body fluids and salt loss from cells
	- Salt Water
		- Hypertonic water loss from cells
	- Land
		- Need to conserve water and salt
		- Land animals are always searching for water as they could die before they reach a water source
- **Intracellular waste**
	- Ammonia can be produced during the digestion of protein
	- Proteins: $CHON\to CO_{2}+H_{2}O+N$
	- Nucleic Acids: $CHOPN\to CO_{2}+H_{2}O+P+N$
## Nitrogen Waste Disposal
- Ammonia $NH_{3}$ can be very toxic and can cross cell membranes easily
- The solution is to dilute it and get rid of it
- Nitrogen Waste
	- **Aquatic Organisms**
		- Can afford to loose water
		- Discard Ammonia (most toxic smallest molecule)
		- Hypotonic Environment 
			- Manage water and waste together
				- Uses extra water in order to dilute ammonia and excrete it through the gills
			- Overcome loss of salts
				- Reabsorb salt in the kidneys or actively transport across the gills
	- **Terrestrial**
		- Need to conserve water
		- Discord Urea (less toxic and larger molecule)
			- Urea = $2NH_{2}+CO_{2}$
			- Produced in the liver
		- Kidney
			- Filter solutes out of the blood
			- Reabsorb $H_{2}O$
			- Excrete waste
				- Urine = Urea, salts, excess sugar and $H_{2}O$
	- **Terrestrial egg layers**
		- need to conserve water
		- need to protect embryo in egg
			- There is no where for the waste to go so it must be the least toxic
		- Discard uric acid (least toxic and largest molecule)
			- Will precipitates out of solution
			- No liquid waste in adults
			- Polymerized Urea
## Kidneys
- Function
	- Filter out solutes from the blood and reabsorb $H_{2}O$ and desired solutions
	- **Filtration**: water and solutes are filtered out of the blood
	- **Reabsorption**: reabsorb needed water and solutes back into the blood
	- **Secretion**: pump out any other unwanted solutes to urine
	- **Excretion**: expel concentrated urine
	- The human kidney contains 1 million nephrons per kidney
## Nephron
- Function
	- Filter out urea and other solutes from the blood plasma
	- selective reabsorption of solutes and $H_{2}O$ back into he blood stream
- Structure
	- The nephron is the interaction of the circulatory and execratory system
	- **Circulatory System**
		- **Glomerulus** (Filtration)= ball of capillaries at the beginning of the nephron
			- Filtered: $H_{2}O$, glucose, salts and ions and urea
			- Unfiltered: cells, proteins
	- **Nephron**
		- **Bowman's Capsule** (Filtration)
			- Blood pressure forces fluids from the glomerulus into the bowman's capsule
		- **Loop of Henle** (Re-absorption)
			- **Proximal tubule** (Re-absorption)
				- reabsorbed back into the blood
				- absorbed: Na through active transport, Cl through diffusion, $H_{2}O$, glucose, bicarbonate buffer for blood pH)
			- **Descending limb** (Re-absorption)
				- reabsorb back into blood
				- absorbed: $H_{2}O$ 
				- The descending limb has lots of aquaporins which is highly permeable but not to salts
			- **Ascending limb** (Re-absorption)
				- reabsorbed back into blood
				- absorbed: $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$
				- many salt channels but no aquaporins
			- **Distal tubule** (Re-absorption)
				- reabsorbed back into blood
				- absorbed: salts, $H_{2}O$, Bicarbonate
		- **Collecting duct** (Reabsorption and Excretion)
			- absorbed: $H_{2}O$
			- Excreted: Concentrated urine is sent to the bladder
- Osmotic Control in the nephron
	- tight osmotic control is used to reduce the energy cost
	- using diffusion instead of active transport wherever possible
- Not filtered out of blood
	- cells
	- proteins
	- remain in blood (too big)
- Reabsorbed back to blood: active transport
	- Na+
	- amino acids
	- glucose
- Reabsorbed back to blood: diffusion
	- H2O
	- Cl–
- Excreted out of body
	- urea
	- excess H2O
	- excess solutes (glucose, salts)
	- toxins, drugs, “unknowns”
