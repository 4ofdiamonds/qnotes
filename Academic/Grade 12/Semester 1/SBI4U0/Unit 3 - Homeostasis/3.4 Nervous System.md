## Neuron
- The neuron is the cell of the nervous system
- Function
		- Many entry points for one signal
		- One path out to transmit the signa 
	- Transmission
		- The nerve is similar to dominoes as it first gets triggered and sends the signal through the nerve. It then needs to reset the signal before it can trigger again
		- There are protein channels set up along the nerve and once the first one opens the rest open in succession
	- Ions
		- Cells live in a sea of charged ions
			- **Anions**: ==Cl-, charged amino acids (aa-)== is more concentrated ==within a cell==
			- **Cations**: ==Na+, K+== is more concentrated in the ==extracellular fluid==
		- This means cells have voltage and they have opposite charges on either side of the membrane
		- Overtime K+ ions will leak out of the cell
		- The membrane in polarized
			- **Negative** inside
			- **Positive** outside
			- **Stores** energy
		- In a nerve cell the resting potential is -70mV
	- Na+ Gates
		- Once the nerve is ==stimulated past the threshold== potential the Na+ channels open and ==Na+ ions diffuse into the cell==
		- Charge ==reverses at that point== and the cell becomes ==depolarized==
		- This ==triggers the next Na+ gate to open== and this repeats until the end of a cell
		- **The action potential** is the wave that moves down the neuron
	- K+ Gates
		- Next the K+ channels open much slower than the Na channels and K+ ions will diffuse out of the cell and the charges reverse back
		- The flow of K+ out of the cell stops the activation of Na+ the wrong direction
	- Reset
		- After the nerve has fully fired there is a sodium potassium pump that uses ATP to reset the charge cross the membrane
			- **3Na+** pumped out
			- **2K+** pumped in
	- Action Potential Graph
		- **Resting potential**
		- **Stimulus reached**
		- **threshold potential**
		- **Depolarization**
			- Na+ channels open
			- K+ channels closed
			- Na+ channels closed
			- K+ channels open
		- **Repolarization**
			- reset charge gradient
		- **Undershoot**
			- K+ channels close slowly
- Structure
	- **Myelin Sheath**: the axon is coated with Schwann cells which insulates the axon and increase the speed of the signal through saltatory conduction
	- **Saltatory Conduction**: In between the Schwann cells is the node and Ranvier 
	- **Synapse**: The end of the axon where the signal must jump from one nerve to the other. The action potential will open up Ca+ channels and release neurotransmitter vesicles. The neurotransmitters will then bind to the protein receptor and the ion-gated channels will open and the new neuron will continue the action potential wave. 
## Brain
- Structure
	- Hind Brain
		- Medulla: Regulation of breathing, blood pressure, heart rate
		- Pons: Coordinating the medulla with the rest of the brain
		- Cerebellum: balance and movement functions
	- Mid Brain
		- Thalamus: information relay station receives and sends information to the brain for processing
		- Hypothalamus: controls hormone production
		- Corpus Callosum: serve as a conduit allowing information to transmit from one side of the brain to the other
	- Fore Brain
		- Includes cerebrum which is responsible for thought, memory
