## DNA
- **Purpose**: Cells need to pass on genetic information to daughter cells
- **Models**
	- **Semiconservative**: where the daughter strands have one template and one original
	- **Conservative**: where the daughter cell is either completely template or completely original
	- **Dispersive**: Where the daughter strands have crossed over DNA from the parents
	- It was proved the the semiconservative model was the right one after the ==Meselson and Stahl Experiment== by tagging some DNA with an isotope of nitrogen
- **Anti-Parallel strands**: the [[1.5 Nucleic Acids|nucleotides]] run in opposite directions for complimentary base pairing
	- Each strand has a 3' and a 5' prime end indicating the direction determined by the [[1.1 Chemistry of Carbon|carbon]] numbers
### DNA Replication
- **Step 0: Bubbles**
	- DNA replication occurs in bubbles along the entire strip of DNA, effectively running in parallel 
- **Step 1: Unwind DNA**
	- **Helicase Enzyme** unwinds the DNA helix
	- **Single-Stranded Binding Proteins** (SSBB) stabilize the DNA preventing it from closing
	- **DNA Gyrase Enzyme** prevents tangling upstream from the replication fork
- **Step 2, 3 and 4: Replication**
	- **RNA Primase** adds an RNA primer to the 3' end of the template DNA
	- **DNA polymerase III** adds new complementary bases to the RNA primer
	- **DNA polymerase I** cleans up by converting RNA primer to DNA
### Leading and Lagging Strands
- DNA polymerase III can only build onto the 3' the end of the nucleotides.
	- **The leading strand** can be continual synthesized in the 3' direction
	- **The lagging strand** has to be synthesized in fragments in the 3' direction
		- **RNA primer** adds RNA primers first then **DNA polymerase III** creates the initial fragment
		- **Okazaki Fragments** are created to overcome the limits of creating DNA in the 5' direction. Multiple Okazaki Fragments are created ahead of each other and are built in the 3' direction
		- **DNA polymerase I** removes the RNA primer
		- **Ligase** glues the fragment together
