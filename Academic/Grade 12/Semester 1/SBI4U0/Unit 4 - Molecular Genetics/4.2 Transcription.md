## The Central Dogma
- **The central dogma**
	- [[4.1 DNA replication|DNA]] can be replicated and pass down through generations
	- DNA can be transcripted into RNA
	- RNA can be translated into proteins
	- Proteins will be expressed as traits
		- Metabolism taught us about genes as a dysfunctional [[2.0 Enzymes|enzyme]] in a metabolic pathway was a phenotype
		- ==This was proven by the Beadle and Tatum Experiment== where they mutated spores and observed which enzyme they were missing as they couldn't synthesize a certain amino acid
## Transcription
- RNA
	- Structure
		- **Ribose Sugar**
		- **N-Bases**
			- Uracil is used instead of thymine
			- U and A
			- C and G
		- **Single Stranded**
	- Function
		- There are many different types of RNA which do more than just transcription
- mRNA (Messenger RNA)
	- Pre Transcription
		- **Template Strand** is the strand that the mRNA is transcripted off of
		- **Coding Strand** is the strand not used but matches the sequence of RNA
		- The method for RNA created follows that of DNA replication but uses ==RNA polymerase instead==. Each RNA has a different promoter region in the genes that it will recognize
			- **RNA polymerase I**
				- Only Transcribes rRNA (ribosomal RNA) genes
				- Creates ribosomes
			- **RNA polymerase II**
				- Transcribes genes into mRNA 
			- **RNA polymerase III**
				- Only transcribes tRNA (transfer RNA)
		- **The promoter region** is the binding site that occurs before the gene and is generally in the form of a ==TATA box==
		- **The enhancer region** is the binding site that farther upstream of the gene and signals the transcription factor to prepare to activate
		- **The initiation complex** is a suite of proteins and transcription factors which turn RNA polymerase on and off
		- Reading Eukaryotic Genes
			- **Exons** = the real genes
			- **Introns** = the junk
	- Post Transcription
		- Splicing
			- After the gene has been read and transcripted the genes are then ==spliced by removing the introns== and the mRNA now consists of only exons. This process has to be accurate or else the ==reading frame can be shifted== which results in inaccurate protein construction
			- **Splicing** is carried out my **snRNP** (small nuclear RNA) which comes together with proteins to create spliceosomes. **Spliceosomes** are able to recognize introns and exons and cut out the introns
			- **Alternative Splicing** is the process of splicing some exons out in order to create different proteins with the same gene
		- Protection
			- mRNA needs to be protected because antiviral enzymes will try to attack the mRNA when it is outside in the cytoplasm
			- **GTP cap** is added onto the **5' end**
			- **poly-A tail** is added onto the **3' end**. The length determines the lifespan of the mRNA and how many proteins it can create
## Translation
- A codon is a ==3 nucleotide frame== that can code for a amino acid
- Since there are more combinations of nucleotides than amino acids there is ==redundancy in the code which allows for a single tRNA molecule to bind to multiple codons==
- **tRNA** is a clover shaped RNA strand which has an amino acid attachment site and a anticodon on the other side which will match to the codons on the mRNA strand
- **Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase** is the enzyme that attaches amino acids to tRNA and creates and unstable bond which can be easily released
- **Ribosomes** facilitate the coupling of tRNA anticodon to the mRNA codon. It is made of rRNA and proteins and has a large and small subunit
	- **A site** holds the next tRNA carrying the next amino acid in the sequence
	- **P site** holds the current tRNA which will bond the amino acid to the chain
	- **E site** empty tRNA which leaves the ribosome
- Building a polypeptide
	- **Initiation** brings together mRNA, ribosome, initiator tRNA
	- **Elongation** is the process of adding amino acids based on the mRNA sequence
	- **Termination** the end codon which finishes the polypeptide chain
- **Signal Peptide** is a sequence that contains the address it is going to be delivered at and once it reaches it the signal peptide is removed
## Protein Synthesis in Prokaryotes
- Unlike Eukaryotes, Prokaryotes have no introns
- This means that transcription and translation can occur at the same time
