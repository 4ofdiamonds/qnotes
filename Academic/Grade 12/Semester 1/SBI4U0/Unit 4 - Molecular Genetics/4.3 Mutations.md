## Mutations
- **Point mutations** are [[1.5 Nucleic Acids|single base]] changes
	- **Silent Mutation** occurs when the base change has no [[1.4 Proteins|amino acid]] change due to redundancy in code
	- **Missense** occurs when there is a change in amino acid
	- **Nonsense** occurs when the mutation codes a stop protein
- **Frameshift Mutations**
	- Shifts the reading frame which can change all the codons downstream
	- **Insertion** is the addition of bases
	- **Deletion** is the loss of bases
