## Bacterial Metabolism
- Bacteria need to respond quickly to their environment
	- Unnecessary production of enzymes can waste materials
	- Once food has been found they need a quick way of enabling enzymes
- [[2.0 Enzymes|Feedback inhibition]] of genes is the primary gene control in prokaryotes by inhibiting genes instead of [[2.0 Enzymes|enzymes]]
	- **Genes that turn off**
		- If a bacteria has enough [[1.4 Proteins|tryptophan]] it will ==turn off== the enzyme that constructs tryptophan
		- If a bacteria encounters [[1.2 Carbohydrates|lactose]] it will ==turn on== the enzyme that will breakdown lactose
## Bacterial Genes
- **Operon**
	- Bacteria will group genes that code for enzymes in the same metabolic pathway
	- **The promoter** in the operon is the [[4.2 Transcription|RNA polymerase]] binding site. If the promoter triggers transcription the entire operon will be transcripted
	- **The Operator** is the DNA binding site for the repressor protein
- **Repressible Operon** (Normally Anabolic Pathways)
	- **Repressor Protein**
		- Tryptophan can bind to a repressor protein which will create a conformational change in the repressor protein which will make the protein active
			- Bind to the operator
			- Block RNA polymerase
			- Block Transcription of the tryptophan enzyme
- **Inducible Operon** (Normally Catabolic Pathways)
	- **Repressor Protein**
		- When there is enough lactose present the lactose will bind to the repressor protein and create a conformational change in the protein which will make it inactive
			- Unbinds from the operator
			- Allows RNA polymerase
			- Causes Transcription of lactose enzymes
