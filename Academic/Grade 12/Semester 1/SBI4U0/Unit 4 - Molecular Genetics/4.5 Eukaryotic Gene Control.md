## Evolution of Gene Control
- [[4.4 Prokaryotic Gene Control|Prokaryotes]] could quickly respond to the environment by turning off on on genes through operators quickly
- Eukaryotes are multicellular and thus had to maintain homeostasis and react to external conditions. The whole body must coordinate together to turn genes off and on for specialization of cells
## Gene Control
- **Packing/Unpacking DNA**
	- [[1.5 Nucleic Acids|DNA]] is packed
		- double helix
		- nucleosomes
		- chromatin fiber
		- looped domains
		- chromosome
	- **Nucleosomes**
		- ==Negatively charged== DNA is wrapped around ==8 positively charged== [[1.4 Proteins|proteins]] to create histones
		- If DNA is packed tight enough [[4.2 Transcription|transcription]] ==is unable to function==
			- **Heterochromatin** = Tightly Packed
			- **Euchromatin** = Loosely Packed
	- **DNA methylation**
		- Attachments of $-CH^3$ [[1.1 Chemistry of Carbon|methyl group]] to cytosine bases will permanently ==stop transcription ==from occurring
	- **Histone Acetylation**
		- Attachment of a $-COCH_{3}$ acetyl group to the histone will provide a conformational change which will ==loosen DNA and enable transcription==
- **Transcription**
	- **Promoter**
		- Nearby sequences of DNA to the gene that will allow for binding of ==RNA polymerase and transcription factors==
	- **Enhancer**
		- Distant sequences of DNA to a gene that activator proteins can bind to enable enhanced levels of transcription
		- **Activator Proteins** are proteins that bind to the enhancer region
		- **Silencer Proteins** are proteins that bind to enhancer region and block transcription
	- **Transcription Complex** is the complex of activator proteins, enhancer regions, RNA polymerase and coactivators
- **mRNA processing**
	- **Alternative Splicing** is the act of processing certain exons to create different proteins
- **mRNA transport**
	- **RNA degradation** is determined by the length of the poly-A tail on the end and determines the lifespan of the mRNA an protein production
	- **siRNA** (small interfering RNA) are short segments of RNA that bind to mRNA and act as a death tag for the mRNA
- **Translation**
	- **Regulatory** proteins can bind to the 5' end of mRNA and prevents the attachment of the ribosomal subunits and tRNA
- **Protein Processing** (transport)
	- Folding
	- Cleaving
	- Adding Sugar Groups
	- Targeting
- **Protein Degredation**
	- **Ubiquintin** is a death tag for proteins made of 76 amino acids
	- **Proteasome** are protein degrading and break proteins into 7-9 amino acids
