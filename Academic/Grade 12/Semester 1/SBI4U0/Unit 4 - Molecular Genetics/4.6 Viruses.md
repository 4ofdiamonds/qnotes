## Viruses
- Structure
	- Genetic Material: [[1.5 Nucleic Acids|DNA]] or RNA
	- Capsid: [[1.4 Proteins|Protein]] Shell
	- Some viruses have viral envelopes
- Viruses have limited host range and enter the host cell though membrane receptors
- High mutation rates due in RNA viruses 
- Function
	- **Classes**
		- **Double Stranded DNA**
		- **Single Stranded DNA**
		- **Double Stranded RNA**
		- **Single Stranded RNA**
			- **Template for mRNA**
			- **Template for DNA** â†’ HIV
	- **Lytic Cycle** uses host metabolic pathways to replicate and assemble copies of itself. ==The cell will die through apoptosis==
	- **Lysogenic Cycle**
		- ==DNA will incorporate== with the host cell DNA and replicate along with the hosts metabolic pathways
			- Bacteriophage DNA = **prophage**
			- Animal Virus DNA = **provirus**
- Bacterial Defense
	- **Natural selection**: cells that prevent phages from entering will survive
	- **Restriction Enzymes** are enzymes that destroy foreign DNA by cutting at a specific point
	- **CRISPR-Cas9 system** are enzymes that identify and cut phage DNA
- Animal Viruses
	- Animal viruses will create an envelope with the host membrane and make it difficult for the immune system to attack it
- **Retrovirus**
	- A retrovirus will use reverse transcriptase in order to incorporate the RNA template into host cell DNA
	- The host will then transcribe the provirus to make new virus parts
## Prevention
- **Vaccines** are a weakened version of the virus which triggers and immune response to prevent infection
- **Antiviral Drugs** are drugs that block viral replication after infection
## Plant Viruses
- Similar structure to animal viruses
- **Horizontal transmission** is when it is infected from another plant
- **Vertical transmission** is transmission inherited from the parent plant
- There are no cures for plant viruses
## Prions
- Misfolded proteins that cause other proteins to misfolded
- Prions act very slowly and there is no cure and they are virtually indestructible
