- All organism use the same DNA which means all DNA codes for the same proteins
- Bacteria can be used to produce human insulin or the human growth hormone
## Genetic Mixing
- **Find Gene**
	- The scissors that we use are [[4.6 Viruses|restriction enzymes]] from bacteria
	- these enzymes will cut [[1.5 Nucleic Acids|DNA]] at specific sites
- **Cut Gene**
	- After the gene has been cut the ends will be "sticky"
- **Insert Gene**
	- We can make the same cut in the chromosome and attach the sticky ends into ends and incorporate the DNA into the chromosome
	- DNA [[4.1 DNA replication|ligase]] is used to stick the DNA together
- Now the newly added genes will produce those specific proteins
## Uses
- GMOS
	- Protect crops from insects
	- Extend growing season
	- Improve quality of food
## Bacteria
- Bacteria are most commonly used because one generation is every 20 minutes
- Bacteria only contain one chromosome loop. Additional smaller segments of DNA are called plasmids
	- Plasmids can carry extra genes for the bacteria and also can be exchanged between different bacteria
	- Bacteria will naturally pick up plasmids from their environment
- **Vector** is a modified plasmid that can be inserted into the bacteria
