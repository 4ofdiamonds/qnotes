## Electrophoresis
- Function
	- In order to compare [[1.5 Nucleic Acids|DNA]] fragments its easiest to separate fragments by size which can be achieved by running DNA through a gel of agarose made by algae
	- By placing DNA in the gel and running an electrical current the negatively charged DNA will "race" to the end and the weight DNA fragments will impact the distance traveled. These fragments are created by adding restriction enzymes to the DNA
	- A stain must be added in order to observe DNA
- Use
	- Each organism will have their own unique DNA fingerprint which can be compared against other samples
	- Patterns are different because of junk DNA which is made up of repeated patterns through the chromosomes
	- **Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism** is the difference in DNA lengths of individuals
## Polymerase Chain Reaction
- PCR can be used to create a mass amount of DNA for electrophoresis
- Materials
	- **Template Strand**
	- **DNA polymerase enzyme**
		- This enzyme comes from Taq polymerase which is a hotspring bacteria which has enzymes that wont denature along with the DNA
	- **Nucleotides**
	- **Primer**
		- Primers are made of a bit of an already existing sequence on the DNA
		- Normally you start with a long piece of DNA and only clone a short section of it
- Steps
	- **Denature DNA**: heat up to 90C
	- **Anneal DNA**: Cool to add primers and build DNA
	- **Extension**: A type of DNA polymerase is needed to add nucleotides
