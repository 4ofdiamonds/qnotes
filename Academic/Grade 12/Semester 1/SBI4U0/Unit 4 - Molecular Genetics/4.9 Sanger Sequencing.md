## DNA sequencing
- Sanger method
	- Structure
		- This method is used to determine the exact sequence of DNA
		- dideoxynucleosides are used in PCR in order to terminate the growth of the chain after a certain point
	- Materials
		- Normal N-Bases
		- Dideoxy N-Bases
		- DNA polymerase
		- Primer
		- Buffers and Salt
	- Steps:
		- Start with multiple radioactive primer base which matches the template strand and add DNA polymerase and ddBases
		- Separate the different nucleic acids and run them through electrophoresis
		- The weight will have the DNA strands run at different lengths and counting them in order will give you the sequence
	- Advancements:
		- Florescent Tagging was used in order to measure all 4 bases in one lane. This also allowed for automation by reading the colors with a laser.
