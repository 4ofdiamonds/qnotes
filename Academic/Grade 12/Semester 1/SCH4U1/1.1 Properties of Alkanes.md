- **Nonpolar**: Insoluble in water but soluble in nonpolar solvents.
- **Low Density**: Less dense than water
- **Low Boiling Points**: Due to weak dispersion forces, boiling points increase with molecular weight.
	- **Gases** at 1-4 carbon atoms
	- **Liquids** at 5-17 carbon atoms
	- **Solids** at 18+ carbons
	- Number of carbon atoms ↑ → bp & mp ↑
	- Number of branches ↑ → bp & mp ↓
- **Reactivity**: Relatively inert; undergo combustion and substitution reactions.
