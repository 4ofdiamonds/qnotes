## Different types of forces
- **Intermolecular Forces (IMF):**
	- **London Dispersion Forces (LDF)**:
	    - Weak forces caused by temporary dipoles in non-polar molecules.
	    - Strength increases with molecular size and surface area.
	- **Dipole-Dipole Forces**:
	    - Occur between polar molecules with permanent dipoles.
	- **Hydrogen Bonding**:
	    - Strong dipole-dipole force when H is bonded to N, O, or F
- **Intramolecular Forces:**
	- **Covalent Bonds**:
	    - Sharing of electrons between atoms.
	    - **Polar Covalent**: Unequal sharing
	    - **Non-Polar Covalent**: Equal sharing
	- **Ionic Bonds**:
	    - Complete transfer of electrons from one atom to another.

## Quantum configuration

## Key Principles
- **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: Impossible to know both position and momentum of an electron simultaneously.
- **Aufbau Principle**: Electrons fill lower energy orbitals first.
- **Hundâ€™s Rule**: Electrons occupy orbitals singly before pairing up within the same sublevel.
- **Sigma Bonds**: Formed by either s-s, s-p or p-p bonding
- **Pi Bonds**: Formed by side-to-side overlap of p-orbitals in double or triple bonds. There are 1 pi bonds in double and 2 pi bonds in triple
- **Van der Waals Forces**: Weak forces, including LDFs and dipole interactions, affecting molecular attractions.
