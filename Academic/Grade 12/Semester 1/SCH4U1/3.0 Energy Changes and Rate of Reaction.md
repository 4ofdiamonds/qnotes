## Writing Rate Laws
- Most common unit: r=$\frac{\Delta[x]}{\Delta t}$ 
	- $\frac{\frac{Mol}{L}}{s}$ = $molL^{-1}S^{-1}$
- Rate of disappearance for reactants
- Rate of appearance for products
- Rate should always be framed **positively**
	- rate of disappearance=$-\frac{\Delta[x]}{\Delta t}$
	- rate of appearance=$\frac{\Delta[x]}{\Delta t}$ 
- **Factors that affect the rate**
	- Anything that increases collision frequency or effectiveness
		- Concentration
		- Temperature
		- Catalysts
		- Surface area
		- Pressure
- **The rate law**
	- The rate law can be determined by taking the exponents of the slowest elementary step
	- Used to express the relationship between concentrations and rate of reaction
	- Orders must be determined empirically 
	- $Rate=k[A]^m[b]^n$
		- Rate is the rate of reaction
		- k is the rate constant
		- a and b are the concentrations
		- m and n are the reaction orders
	- Orders:
		- In order to calculate order you must do so by isolating a certain reaction
		- Order of zero:
			- The rate is unaffected by the concentration, the rate will go down at a constant rate until it is all used up
		- Order of one:
			- The rate will decrease constantly as concentration gets smaller
			- When concentration doubles, rate doubles
		- Order of two:
			- The rate will decrease linearly as the concentration gets smaller
			- When concentration doubles, rate quadruples
	- Solving for K units:
		- substitute the units into the rest of the equation and solve for k units
		- Shorter method: $k=\frac{mol^{order-1}}{l^{order-1}s}$
- **Reaction Mechanisms**
	- Activated Complex: The activated complex is the highest energy point on the reaction pathway. It is the transition state between reactants and products.
	- Activation Energy: The activation energy (Ea) is the difference between the energy of the activated complex and the energy of the reactants. It represents the minimum energy required for a reaction to occur.
	- Rate-Limiting Step: The rate-limiting step is the slowest step in the reaction mechanism. It determines the overall rate of the reaction.
		- Use the rate-limiting step in order to determine the overall rate law of the reaction
## Energy Changes
- **Thermics**
	- Endothermic reactions: The reaction absorbs heat energy, $\Delta H>0$
	- Endothermic reactions: The reaction releases heat energy, $\Delta H<0$
	- Energy can be stored in either potential energy or kinetic energy. Kinetic energy will result in heat loss
- **Calculating Standard Heat of Reaction**
	- $\Delta H$ is enthalpy
	- $\Delta H_{f}$ is enthalpies of formation
	- $\Delta H=\sum \Delta H_{f}(\text{products})-\sum \Delta H_{f}(\text{reactants})$
- **Calculating heat (q)
	- $q_{surr}=mc\Delta T$
		- $m$ is the mass of the object
		- $c$ is the specific heat capacity or the resistance the material has to changes in temperature
		- $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature
		- $q$ is heat energy in jewels
	- $q_{system}=-q_{surroundings}$
	- $\Delta H=\frac{q}{n}$
		- $\Delta H$ is molar energy
		- $q$ is energy of the reaction in kJ
		- $n$ is moles
		- Always use the limiting reagent in calculations
