- Arrhenius definition:
	- Acid: substance that increases $[H_{3}O+]$ in solution;
	- Base: substance that increases $[OH-]$ in solution;
- Brφnsted-Lowry definition:
	- Acid: reactant that donates proton in a reaction;
	- Base: reactant that accepts proton in a reaction;
- Lewis definition:
	- Acid: one that accept electron-pairs
	- Base: one that donate electron-pairs
- **Equations**
- pKa = -log(ka)
- pKb = -log(kb)
- pKa+pKb=14
- pH=-log(H)
- pOH=-log(pOH)
- pH+pOH=14
- pH x pOH = kw
- $ka\cdot kb=kw$
- $kw$ = $1.0\cdot 10^{-14}$

- ## Equilibrium
- $K_{eq}=\frac{[Products]}{[Reactants]}$
	- Only ==gases and aqueous== solutions should be included in this expression
	- Coefficients become ==exponents==
- $aA+bB\leftrightharpoons cC+dD$
- $K_{eq}=\frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a{[B]}^b}$
## Ice Table (Initial, Change, and Equilibrium)
- **Acids/Bases**
	- Write the balanced equation and initial concentrations.
	- Determine the changes (+x, −x, etc.) based on stoichiometry.
	- Solve for x using the Keq expression.
	- Usage of the 100 rule can be applied here
		-  If $\frac{[Initial]}{K_{eq}}>100$ drop x
- **Salts**
	- Salts are an anion and cation together
	- If the anion (acid) combined with H is a strong acid then it is neutral. If it is weak than it is a acidic salt
	- If the cation (base) combined with OH is a strong base it is neutral. If it is weak than it is a basic salt
	- Calculate as you would with a normal acid or base but if it is the anion treat it as a base and if it is a cation treat it as an acid. This is because it is either a conjugate acid or conjugate base
