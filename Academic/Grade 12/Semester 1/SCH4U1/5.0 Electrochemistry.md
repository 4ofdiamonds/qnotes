**Redox**
- Oxidation Numbers:
	- Rules
		- Total must add to the charge
		- Add the numbers of all the other ions
		- H will always be +1 unless hydrive
		- O will always be -2 unless peroxide
		- Group 1 is +1
		- Group 2 is +2
	- More positive = oxidation
	- More negative = reduction
- Balancing Redox reactions:
	- Seperate redox reactions using the oxidation numbers
	- Balance both equations ignoring O and H
	- Balance by adding H2O
	- Balance by adding H
		- For basic mediums add OH
	- Balance the charge
	- Multiply each equation so there are the same number of electrons in each
	- Add the half reactions and simplify
**Activity Series**
- The higher elements are more reactive and can replace other elements through displacement
- Higher = Strong oxidizing agent (gets reduced, gains electrons)
- Lower = Strong reducing agent (gets oxidized, looses electrons)
**Galvanic Cells**
- Electrons flow from anode to cathode.
	- Anode = Negatively charged ions flow towards it (Oxidation because of loss of electrons)
		- Here ions are then formed in the acidic solution
	- Cathode = Positively charged ions flow towards it (Reduction because of gain of electrons)
		- Here atoms are formed on the cathode
	- $E_{cell}=E_{cathode}-E_{anode}$ 
	- Spontaneous
		- Anode has a positive cell potential
		- Cathode has a negative cell potential
	- Salt Bridge
		- Maintains electrical neutrality by reacting with the ions 
			- The NO3- is attracted to the Cu- ions
			- The K+ is attracted to the NO3
