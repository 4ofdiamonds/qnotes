The Lewis structure models valence electrons and bonding between elements.

```Example
NH3

Ve = Ve of N + Ve of H(3) = 5 + 3
Ve = 8
  ‥        ‥
H:N:H -> H-N-H
  ‥        |
  H        H
```

```Example 2
CO2

Ve = Ve of C + Ve of O(2) = 4 + 12
Ve = 16
 ‥     ‥
:O::C::O: -> O=C=O
```

Each element must follow the octet rule where they have a total of 8 valence electrons each except for atoms like boron, phosphorus or beryllium. 

```Example
PCl5

Ve = 5+35 = 40
```
