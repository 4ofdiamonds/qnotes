Each shell contains a different amount of orbitals where electrons exist within a certain probability of an area. These areas come in different shapes such as s, p, d and f orbitals. s orbitals only have 1 orientation and are sphere shaped, p orbitals have 3 orientations and are dumbbell shaped, and d orbitals are clover shaped and can have 5 different orientations.

Depending on the amount of electrons in an atom we can figure out which orbitals all the electrons are in. The electrons start by filling the s, p, d and f orbitals from lowest to highest energy. 

```Example:
Mg=12e-

Pauli Exclusion Principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers

Hund's Rule: Orbitals of equal energy are each occupied by one electron before any orbital is occupied by a second electron, and all electrons in single occupied orbitals must have the same spin.

Aufbau Principle: An electron occupies the lowest-energy orbital that can receive it.
