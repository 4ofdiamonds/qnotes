3d model of the electron configuration of an atom. With the atom we can figure out what shape the bond angles will be for a stable structure. With this model, lone pair electrons repel more than bonds. This is a more accurate version of a singular atom than [[Lewis Structures]]

A=Central Atom
X=Surrounding atom
E=Lone Pairs

```Example
AX2 -> X-A-X [Linear shape]

BeF2 = AX2

Ve = 2 + 14
Ve = 16

 ‥   ‥
:F:B:F: -> F-B-F
 ‥   ‥
```

```Example
SeH4

LD: 4(H)-Se:

VD: Trigonal Bipyramidal - Seesaw
```

```Example
CCl4

VD: Tetrahedral 

Polarity: Non-polar

- Shape: Symmetrical
- Electronegativity: Cl->C= 0.5
```
