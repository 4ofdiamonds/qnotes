- Formalism
	- The idea behind formalism is analyzing a text objectively, looking only at its formal elements. 
	- Bringing out an idea that is universal and not tied to author, reader or any particular social issue. It came about trying to look at it scientifically and extracting a truth from it.
	- Turned into New Historicism in the West
	- Utilizes close reading with special emphasis on connotative and associate values of words. 
	- Formalism presumes that the work you are analyzing is standalone
