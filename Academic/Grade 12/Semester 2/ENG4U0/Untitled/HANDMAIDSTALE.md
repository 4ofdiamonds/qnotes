- Question: How do regimes attempt to exterminate hope within their population
	- Value of a name and choices: 
	- Memories and HP: 
		- Increase max HP by defying the gilead
		- Increase hope by using memories and different symbols around the world
	- Fighting with other people, lack of communication: 
	- Very little to do in the game
- Areas of the game

	- Dead Daughter
	- Super Position of Luke

	- A different version of Offred
	- You is when Offred while, I is referring to the player
	- Offred → Loosing Hope
	- Player → Maintaining Hope

	- Tokens
- Attacking means:  Gaining Power → Gaining Control over others → Others have less hope
	- At the beginning LV means level of volume or how heard you are and the more heard you are the greater your collective hope
	- Lacking Fertility in the presence of power
	- Faking Fertility in the presence of the handmaids
- Defending means: Preventing yourself from loosing hope and creating a collective hope
- How does a fight between the player (old offred) and her daughter (source of hope)
	- Should be a fight between the gileads oppression and the old offred
