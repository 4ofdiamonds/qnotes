## Lesson
- At a school where a school is mandatory, the students have a choice between black or gray pants, a white golf shirt, a white button down shirt, or black golf shirt, and black shoes or brown shoes. Draw a tree diagram to illustrate the different outcomes
- To count the number without a tree diagram, multiply the number of possible outcomes per event to get total outcomes
- Fundamental Counting Principle:
	- If one event has m possible outcomes and a second independent even has n possible outcomes, then there are mxn total possible outcomes for the two events together
