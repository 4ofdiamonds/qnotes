## Lesson
- In many situations you need to determine the number of different order in which you can choose or place a set of items
- Permutation of n items
	- How many different ways can I arrange 4 students in the 4 front row seats of my classroom?
	- $4!=4\times 3\times 2 \times 1=24$
- Factorials
	- $$n!=n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)\dots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$$
	- $8! =40320$
	- $11! =39916800$
	- $\frac{18!}{15!}=4896$
	- $14 \times 13 \times 12! =14!$
	- $72 \times 7! = 9!$
	- $n(n-1)(n-2)! = n!$
	- Without a factorial button simplify the expression
		- $\frac{25!}{23!}=\frac{25\times 24 \times 23!}{23!}=600$
- Permutation of r Items out of n Items
	- How many different ways can the front row of my classroom (4 seats) be arranged if there are 10 students in the class
	- $10\times 9 \times 8\times 7=\frac{10!}{6!}=\frac{10!}{(10-4)!}$
	- $$nPr=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$
	- $$P(n,r)=nPr$$
	- $10P_{4}=P(10,4)=5040$
- Examples
	- 1. Find the number of ways of arranging the letters of the word MATCHING if
		- a) there are no restrictions
			- $8! =40230$ or $8P_{8}$
		- b) the first letter must be an M
			- $7! =5040$
		- c) The arrangement must end with NG
			- $6! =720$
		- d) the odd number positions must remain unchanged
			- $4! =24$
	- 2. Emilio has picked up his textbooks for the seven courses he will study this year. In how many ways can he arrange them on his shelf if
		- a) there are no restrictions
			- $7! =5040$
		- b) the French and German textbook must be beside each other
			- $6! \times 2=1440$
		- c) the French and German textbook must not be beside each other
			- $n_{total}-n_{restricted}=7!-(6! \times 2)$
	- 3. How many ways can you arrange the letters of the word FACTOR if
		- a) there are no restrictions?
			- $7! =5040$
		- b) The CT must stay together
			- $6! =720$
		- c) The FACT must be together and in order
			- $4! =24$
		- d) The FACT must be together
			- $3! \times 4! =144$
	- 4. Eight Siblings are to line up for a photograph
		- a) How many different arrangements are possible
			- $8!$
		- b) How many arrangements have the youngest and oldest at either end
			- $6!$
		- c) How many arrangements are there if the youngest and oldest must not be together
			- $8!-(2\times 6!)$
		- d) How many arrangements are there if the three oldest siblings have to stay together
			- $3! \times 6!$
