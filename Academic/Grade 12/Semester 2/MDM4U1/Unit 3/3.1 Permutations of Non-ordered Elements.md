## Lesson
- List all the distinct arrangements for the following words:
	- MOM
		- Generally: 3!=6
		- $6 \to 3$
		- $\frac{6}{2}=3$
		- $\text{two ms} \implies \frac{3!}{2!}$
		- MMO
		- OMM
		- MOM
	- LULL
		- Generally 4!=24
		- $24 \to 4$
		- $\text{3 Ls }\implies \frac{4!}{3!}$
		- LLLU
		- LLUL
		- ULLL
		- LULL
	- PASS
		- Generally 4!=24
		- $24 \to 12$
		- $\text{2 S} \implies \frac{4!}{2!}$
		- SSAP
		- SSPA
		- SASP
		- SPSA
		- SAPS
		- SPAS
		- ASSP
		- PSSA
		- ASPS
		- PSAS
		- APSS
		- PASS
	- ABBA
		- Generally 4!=24
		- $24 \to 6$
		- $\text{2 A 2 B} \implies \frac{4!}{2!2!}$
		- AABB
		- ABAB
		- BBAA
		- BABA
		- BAAB
		- ABBA
	- General Formula
		- The number of permutations of n objects, when p of one type are identical, q of another type are identical, r of another type are identical and so on:
		- $$\frac{n!}{p!q!r!}$$
- Examples
	- In how many ways can the letters of the word MINIMUM be arranged?
		- $\frac{7!}{2!3!}=420$
	- A hockey team ended its season with 12 wins, 8 losses and 4 ties, In how many orders could these outcomes have happened?
		- $\frac{24!}{12!8!4!}=1338557220$
	- How many numbers greater than 300000 are there using only the digits 1,1,1,2,2,3?
		- $\frac{5!}{3!2!1!}=10$
	- How many  seven digit even numbers less than 3000000
		-  $\frac{5!}{2 \times 2}+\frac{5!}{2}+2 \frac{5!}{2}$
