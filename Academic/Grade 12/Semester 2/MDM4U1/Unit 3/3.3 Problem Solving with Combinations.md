## Lesson
- All possible combination of distinct items?
	- I have an apple and banana in my lunch bag. How many ways can I choose what to eat as my snack?
		- apple, banana, apple and banana, 3 different ways
	- I have an apple, banana, and orange in 
		- A, B, O, AB, AO, BO, ABO, 7 different ways
	- The total number of combinations containing at least one item chosen from a group of n distinct items is: 
		- $$2^n-1$$
		- The 2 comes from either picking or not picking the item and -1 from the empty set
		- Combinations are subsets of the group of n objects. A null set is a set that has no elements
