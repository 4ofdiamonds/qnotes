## Lesson
- What pattern is used to create each row?
	- Start with 1 at the top and each row is created by adding the two terms directly above to get the value
- What is the pattern in the second diagonal withing pascals triangle?
	- The second diagonal is the set of natural numbers
- What is the pattern in the third diagonal?
	- The numbers are triangular numbers
- Add the terms in
	- Row 0: 1
	- Row 1: 2
	- Row 3: 4
	- Row 4: 8
	- Row 5: 16
- What conclusion could you make about the sum of the terms in the row and then row number?
	- $2^n$ where n is the row number
- Patterns
	- Hockey stick patterns:

## Binomial Expansion
- You can use the binomial theorem to expand any power of binomial expressions
	- $$\sum_{r=0}^{n}nCrx^{n-r}y^r$$
	- Use the binomial theorem to expand: 
		- $(x+y)^5$
		- $=5C_{0} (x^5)+5C_{1} (x^4y)+5C_{2}(x^3y^2)+5C_{3}(x^2y^3)+5C_{4}(xy^4)+5C_{5}(y^5)$
	- Use the binomial theorem to expand:
		- $(3a^2+2ab^3)^4$
		- $4C 0(3a^2)^4+4C 1(3a^2)^3(2ab^3)+4C 2(3a^2)^2(2ab^3)^2+4C 3(3a^2)(2ab^3)^3+4C 4(3ab^3)^4$
	- Find the 4th term in expansion of:
		- $(2x+3y)^8$
		- $=8C 3(2x)^5(3y)^3$
		- $=56(32x^5)(27y^3)$
		- $=48384x^5y^3$
	- Find the 6th term of $(5m^3+4m^2)^{11}$
		- $11C 5=(5m^3)^6(4m^2)^5$
	- Find the coefficient of $x^7y^3$ from $(x+y)^{10}$
		- $10C_{3}=120$
	- Find the coefficient of $x^6y^4$ from $(x^2+3x^2)^5$
		- $5C_{2}(x^2)^3(3y^2)^2$
		- $10x^69xy^4$
		- $90x^6y^4$
	- Find the coefficient of $a^6b^{10}$ from $(2a^3-4b^2)^7$]
		- $7C_{5}(2a^3)^2(-4b^2)^5$
		- $21(9a^3)(-1024b^{10})$
		- $-193536$
