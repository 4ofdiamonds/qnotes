## Lesson
- Combinations are sometimes used toe determine probabilities.
	- $p(a)=\frac{n(a)}{n(s)}$
- Example 1: To win the grand prize in a fundraising draw, you need to match seven numbers from 1 to 27 without regard to order
	- What is the chance of wining the grand prize?
		- $P(\text{grand prize})=\frac{1}{27C_{7}} \implies \text{ only one way to match all numbers}$
		- $P(\text{grand prize})=0.0001126$%
	- What is the percent chance of winning second prize, which invovles matching six of the seven winning numbers?
		- $P(\text{second prize})=\frac{7C_{6} \times 20C_{1}}{27C_{7}}=0.01577$%
	- What is the percent chance of not winning either?
		- $P(\text{not winning first or second})=1-p(\text{win first})-p(\text{win second})$
- Example 2:
	- A teacher uses a random name generator to select six student to present their projects. In a class of 23 students, 12 are male and 11 are female.
		- What is the probability that an equal number of male and female students will present?
			- $p(\text{equal number})=\frac{12C_{3} \times 11C_{3}}{23C_{6}}=\frac{1100}{3059}$
		- What is the probability that more female than male students will present?
			- $p(\text{more female})= \frac{12C_{2} \times_{1}11C_{4}+12C_{1} \times 11C_{5} + 12C_{0} \times 11C_{6}}{23C_{6}}=\frac{842}{3059}$
- Example 4:
	- Adrian has 15 classmates. He selects four of the for form a study group. What is the probability that reg or Carlos is selected.
		- $p(\text{carlos or reg})=\frac{1}{}$
