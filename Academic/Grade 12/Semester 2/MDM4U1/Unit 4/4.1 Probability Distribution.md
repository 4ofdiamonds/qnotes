 ## Lesson
- Probability distribution
	- The probabilities for all possible outcomes of an experiment or sample space
	- Often shown as a table or graph of probability versus the value of a random variable
- The sum of the probabilities in any distribution is 1
- Random Variable $X$
	- has a single value for each outcome in an experiment
	- For example, the random variable X might be the number rolled on a die, then x can equal 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- There are two types of random variables
	- Discrete Random Variables: 
		- Variables tat can only have certain values withing a given range
		- Example: Numbers of a die, numbers of siblings
	- Continuous random variables:
		- Variable that can have an infinite number of possible values withing a given range
		- Example: Tie it takes to run a race, height of student.
- Probability Histogram
	- A graph of a probability distribution in which equal intervals are marked on the horizontal axis and the probabilities associated with these intervals are indicated by bars; the bars are not separated and there is space between the y axis and the bars. 
## Examples
- Example 1: There table gives the percent breakdown of the number of rooms in apartments in a particular complex 

| Numbers of rooms, x | Percent P(X) |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| 2                   | 15           |
| 3                   | 30           |
| 4                   | 42           |
| 5                   | 10           |
| 6                   | 3            |

	- a) Identify variable X
		- Number of rooms in apartments
	- b) Construct a probability histogram
	- c) Explain the meaning of the individual bars in the histogram
		- It is the percent of houses that have x rooms
	- d) Describe the distribution
		- Non Symmetrical, heavier on the right side
	- e) Calculate the sum of the probabilities
		- 100
- Example 2: A spinner has two equal sectors, coloured red and blue
	- a) make a tree diagram to show the probability distribution of the number of times that spinner lands on blue when it is spun three times
		- RRR
		- RRB
		- RBR
		- RBB
		- BRR
		- BRB
		- BBR
		- BBB
	- b) Make a probability distribution for the number of times the spinner lands on blue when it is spun three times. 

| Number of time spinner lands on blue (x) | Distribution  | Frequency | Probability |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| 0                                        | RRR           | 1         | 1/8         |
| 1                                        | BRR, RBR, RRB | 3         | 3/8         |
| 2                                        | RBB, BRB, BBR | 3         | 3/8         |
| 3                                        | BBB           | 1         | 1/8         |
- c) Calculate the expected value, E(X), for the number of times the spinner lands on blue
	- An expectation or expected value, E(X), for distribution is the predicted average of all possible outcomes of a probability experiment. The expectation us equal to the sum of the products of each outcomes. (random variable=$x_{i}$ with its probability p($x_{i}$))
	- $$\sum_{i=0}^n=x_{i} \times p(x_{i})=0\left( \frac{1}{8} \right)+1\left( \frac{3}{8} \right)+2\left( \frac{3}{8} \right)+3\left( \frac{1}{8} \right)=1.5$$
- Example 3:  Consider a simple game in which you roll a single dice. If you roll an even number, you get that number of points and if you roll an odd number, you loose that number of points. 
	- a) Set up a probability distribution of the points in this game

| Number on die | Points | P(x) | xp(x) |
| ------------- | ------ | ---- | ----- |
| 1             | -1     | 1/6  | -1/6  |
| 2             | +2     | 1/6  | +2/6  |
| 3             | -3     | 1/6  | -3/6  |
| 4             | +4     | 1/6  | +4/6  |
| 5             | -5     | 1/6  | -5/6  |
| 6             | +6     | 1/6  | +6/6  |
- b) Calculate the expected value for the number of points per roll
	- $$e(x)=-\frac{1}{6}+\frac{2}{6}-\frac{3}{6}+\frac{4}{6}-\frac{5}{6}+\frac{6}{6}=0.5$$
- c) Is this a fair game?
	- No because fair games must have an expected value of 0.5
