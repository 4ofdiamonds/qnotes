## Lesson
- Repeated independent trials measured in terms of successes and failures are Bernoulli trails
- For binomial distributions, all the trials are independent and have two possible outcomes - success or failure. The probability of success is the same in every trial. The random variable is the number of success in a given number of trials. 
- The probability of x successes in n independent trials is: 
	- $$p(x)=nCxp^xq^{n-z}$$
	- $$p(x)=\text{number of indepeent trials}$$
	- $$x=\text{number of successes}$$
	- $$\text{p is the probability of success}$$
	- $$\text{q is the probability of failure}$$
- Example 1: Prepare a table and a graph for the binomial distribution p=0.2, n=5
	- If probability of success is 0.2, then probability of failure, q, s 0.8

| Number of sucesses | P(x)                           |     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | --- |
| 0                  | $5C_{0}(0.2)^0(0.8)^5=0.3276$  |     |
| 1                  | $5C_{1}(0.2)^1(0.8)^4=0.4096$  |     |
| 2                  | $5C_{2}(0.2)^2(0.8)^3=0.2048$  |     |
| 3                  | $5C_{3}(0.2)^3(0.8)^2=0.0512$  |     |
| 4                  | $5C_{4}(0.2)^4(0.8)^1=0.0064$  |     |
| 5                  | $5C_{5}(0.2)^5(0.8)^0=0.00032$ |     |

- Example 2: The faces of a 12 sided die are number from 1 to 12. What is the probability of rolling 9 at least twice in ten tries
	- ==not asking for distribution==
	- Variables
		- p=1/12
		- q=11/12
		- n=10
	- Equations
		- $$p(\text{at least 2})=\text{total}-p(0)-p(1)$$
- $$p(\text{at least 2})1-10C_{0}\left( \frac{1}{12} \right)^0\left( \frac{11}{12} \right)^{10}-10C_{1}\left( \frac{1}{12} \right)^1\left( \frac{11}{12} \right)^9$$
- $$p(\text{at least 2})=0.2003$$
- Example 3: A family has six children, Consider a probability distribution for the number of girls in the family.
	- Variables
		- p=1/2
		- q=1/2
		- n=6
	- a) Calculate the probability Distribution

| Number of girls | P(x)                                                             |

- Calculate E(x)
	- $$E(x)=0(0.015625)+1(0.01375)+2(0.23475)+3(0.3125) +4(0.23475)+5(0.09375)+6(0.015625)$$
- Expectation for a binomial distribution
	- Multiply the number of trails by the probability of success in an individual trial
	- $$E(x)=np$$
