## Examples
- 1. A game consists of randomly selecting a number from 1 to 15 out of a hat (equal sized slips of paper). If you select the number 13 you win a prize. 
	- a) What type of distribution is this?
		- Uniform
	- b) What is the expected value?
		- $$e(x)=\frac{1}{15}(1+2+3\dots 14+15)=\frac{1}{15}\left( \frac{15(15+1)}{2} \right)=8$$
- 2. A game consists of choosing a number out of a hat 5 times. Each time a number is chosen, it is replaced. A prize is won if you choose 7 at least 3 times.
	- a) What type of distribution is this?
		- binomial
	- b) $$e(x)=np$$
	- $$e(x)=(5)\left( \frac{1}{15} \right)=0.3$$
- 3. A game consists of choosing a number out of a hat 5 times. Each time a number is chosen, it is not replaced. A prize is won if you choose an odd number at least 3 times. 
	- a) What type of distribution is this?
		- Hypergeometric. 
	- b) What is the expected value?
		- $$e(x)=\frac{ra}{n}$$
		- $$e(x)=\frac{5(8)}{15}=2.7$$
