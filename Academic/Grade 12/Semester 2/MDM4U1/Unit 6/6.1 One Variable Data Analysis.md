## Lesson
- It is sometimes useful to summarize a set of data using values around which a set of data tends to cluster.
### Central Tendency Data
- Three most commonly used measures of central tendency are: 
	- Mean (Average) - sum of values of a variable divided by the number of values
		- Population
			- $$M=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4} \dots +x_{n}}{N}$$
			- $M=mn$
			- $N\to\text{Population Size}$
		- Sample
		- $$\bar{x}=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4}\dots+x_{n}}{n}$$
		-  $\bar{x}=\text{x bar}$
		- $n=\text{Sample Size}$
	- Median - Middle value of the data when they are ranked; it is the midpoint between 2 middle values when you have an even number of values
	- Mode - Values that occurs most frequently
- **Outliers**: values that are distant from the majority of data, have a greater effect on the mean than on the median of a set of data
### Grouped Data
- When data are grouped into intervals, you can only approximate the center of the data. Use the midpoint of the interval to represent the values in each interval.
	- $$\bar{x}=\Sigma f_{i}m_{i}$$
- Example: A group of teens were asked how many hours a week they typically spend watching television

| Number of Hours | Frequency of Teens | Midpoint |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| 0-2             | 1                  | 1        |
| 2-4             | 4                  | 3        |
| 4-6             | 7                  | 5        |
| 6-8             | 3                  | 7        |
| 8-10            | 2                  | 9        |
| 10-12           | 1                  | 11       |
- Total = 18
- Find the mean, median and mode
	- Mean
		- $$\bar{x}=1(1)+4(3)+7(5)+3(7)+2(9)+1(11)$$
		- $$\frac{98}{18}$$
		- $$\bar{x}=5.4 \text{ hours}$$
	- Median
		- $$18 \text{ values } \therefore \text{9th and 10th are the middle}$$
### Weighted Mean
- Sometimes certain data within a set are more significant than others. A weighted mean gives a measure of central tendency that reflects the relative importance of the data. 
	- $$M_{w}=\frac{\sum x_{i}w_{i}}{\sum w_{i}}$$
- Example: An award committee uses the following weight factors to help decide award winners at the school. Each applicant is scored from 1 to 5 in each category
	- Marks: 3
	- Application: 2
	- Interview: 2
	- Extra-Curricular activities: 1
	- Pan: 4, 4, 2, 5
		- $$\text{Pam: }\bar{x=\frac{4+4+2+5}{4}=3.75}$$
		- $$\text{Pam: }\bar{x=\frac{4(3)+4(2)+2(2)+5(1)}{4}=}$$
	- Jim: 3, 4, 5, 5
		- $$\text{Jim: } \bar{x}=\frac{3+4+5+5}{4}=4.25$$
		- $$\text{Jim: } \bar{x}=\frac{3(3)+4(2)+5(2)+5(1)}{4}=4.25$$
	- Michael: 5, 4, 3, 4
		- $$\text{Michael: } \bar{x}=\frac{5+4+3+4}{4}=4$$
		- $$\text{Michael: } \bar{x}=\frac{5(3)+4(2)+3(2)+4(1)}{4}=4$$
