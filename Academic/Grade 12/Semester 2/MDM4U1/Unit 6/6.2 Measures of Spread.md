 ## Lesson
- A measure of spread helps you understand how closely a set of data is clustered around its center (how spread out the data is)
- Measures of central tendency: Mean, Median, Mode
- Measures of spread: Range, Interquartile Range, Semi-Interquartile Range, Standard Deviation, Variance
- Quartiles and Interquartile Ranges
	- Quartiles - divide a set of ordered data into 2 groups with equal numbers of values, just as the median divides data into two equally sized groups
	- The second quartile (Q2) is the same as the median
	- The first quartile (Q1) is the middle of the first half of the data and the third quartile (Q3) is the middle of the second half of the data.
	- Interquartile Range (IQR) = Q3-Q1
	- Semi-interquartile Range (SIQR)=Interquartile Range divided by 2
- Outliers
	- Outliers are more than 1.5 times the box size away from the box
	- $$>Q_{3}+1.5 \times IQR$$
	- $$<Q_{1}-1.5 \times IQR$$
## Example
- Determine the range, quartiles, interquartile range, and semi interquartile range. Draw a box and whisker plot
	- 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11, 25
		- $\text{Range: }25-1=24$
		- $\text{Q2: 8}$
	- First Half
		- 1, 3, 3, 4, 4
		- $Q_{1}=3$
	- Second Half
		- 9, 10, 11, 11, 25
		- $Q_{3}=11$
	- Interquartile Ranges
		- $IQR=11-3=8$
		- $SIQR=\frac{8}{2}=4$
	- Outliers: 
		- $>11+8 \times 1.5$
		- $>23$
		- $<3-8 \times 1.5$
		- $<-9$

- Grouped Data: A summer camp activity involves measuring the distance travelled by 50 turtles in 15 min. The table shows the results:
	- 

| Midpoint | Frequency | F x m |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| 2.5      | 1         | 2.5   |
| 7.5      | 0         | 0     |
| 12.5     | 6         | 75    |
| 17.5     | 12        | 210   |
| 22.5     | 15        | 3375  |
| 27.5     | 5         | 137.5 |
| 32.5     | 7         | 227.5 |
| 37.5     | 1         | 37.5  |
| 42.5     | 3         | 127.5 |
- $\text{Total: 1155}$
	- $\text{Mean: } \frac{1155}{50}=23.1$
	- $\text{Median (25th and 26th places): } \frac{22.5+22.5}{2}=22.5$
	- $\text{Mode: } 22.5$
	- $\text{Model Interval: 20-25}$
	- $\text{Q1 (13th place): 17.5}$
	- $\text{Q3 (38th place): 32.5}$
## Percentiles (Continued)
- Quartiles divide data into 4 equal parts
- Percentiles divide data into 100 equal parts
	- Q2 = 50th percentile
	- Q1 = 25th percentile
	- Q3 = 75th percentile
- A percentile is the percent of all the data that are less than or equal to the a specific data value
	- Often used in standardized test scores, growth and height charts
- Ex if you received a mark in the 90th percentile in a math contest
	- Did no get a 90% on the contest
	- Universal general understanding
		- 90% of the data are below this point, so you scored better than 90% of the competitors
- Percentile Rank
	- $$\underbrace{ \text{R} }_{ \text{whole number of data points} }= \frac{\overbrace{ p }^{ \text{percentile} }}{100}(\underbrace{ n }_{ \text{population size}}+1)$$
- Percentile
	- $$P=100\left( \frac{\overbrace{ L }^{ \text{number of data points below} }+0.5\overbrace{ E }^{ \text{number of data points the same} }}{\underbrace{ n }_{ \text{population size} }} \right)$$
## Examples
- The mean playing times per game for the 22 hockey players on a team are: 
	- $$\begin{array}{rr}
1 & 8.3 \\
2 & 9.2 \\
3 &  12.0 \\
4 &  12.4 \\
5 &  13.4 \\
6 &  13.8 \\
7 &  14.6 \\
8 & 15.2 \\
9 &  16.4 \\
10 &  16.7 \\
11 &  17.4 \\
12 &  17.9 \\
13 &  17.9 \\
14 &  18.1 \\
15 &  18.3 \\
16 &  18.5 \\
17 &  20.5 \\
18 &  21.7  \\
19 &  21.7 \\
20 &  22.6 \\
21 &  23.4 \\
22  & 24.3
\end{array}$$
	- a) Determine the 40th and 95th percentile$$
\begin{array}{\text{40th percentile:}} \\
R & = &  \frac{p}{100}(n+1) \\
R & =  & \frac{40}{100}(22+1) \\
R& = &  9.2
\end{array}
\begin{array}{rr}
\text{Use 9th and 10th percetile} \\
\frac{16.4+16.7}{2}=16.55 \text{ minutes}
\end{array}$$
	- b) What is the percentile is the players who averaged
		- i) 9.2 min per game
		- ii) 21.7 mine per game
		- iii) 18.1 min per game
