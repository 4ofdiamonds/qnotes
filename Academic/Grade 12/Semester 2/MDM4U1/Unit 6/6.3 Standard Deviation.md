## Lesson
- Variance
	- Describes the relative distance between the data points and the mean of the data set
	- it is found by squaring the deviation of each of the data values, and taking the average
	- deviation is how different something is from the mean of the population, it is found by subtracting the mean from each individual data value
	- outliers have a big effect on variance since the deviations are squared
	- Formulas:
		- Population Variance: $$\sigma^2=\frac{\sum(x-u)^2}{N}$$
			- $\text{x is data point}$
			- $\text{u is population mean}$
			- $\text{N is the population size}$
		- Sample Variance: $$\sigma^2=\frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}{N-1}$$
			- $\text{x is data point}$
			- $\text{u is population mean}$
			- $\text{N is the population size}$
- Standard Deviation
	- Square root of the variance
	- Is more useful in a lot of cases because it is in the same units as the original data 
	- A large standard deviation indicates that the data is far from the mean and a small standard deviation indicates that they are clustered closely around the mean
	- Formulas: 
		- Population Standard Deviation: $$\sigma^2=\frac{\sum(x-u)^2}{N}$$
			- $\text{x is data point}$
			- $\text{u is population mean}$
			- $\text{N is the population size}$
		- Sample Standard Deviation: $$\sigma^2=\frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}{N-1}$$
			- $\text{x is data point}$
			- $\text{u is population mean}$
			- $\text{N is the population size}$
- Z-Score
	- Indicates how many standard deviations a data value lies from the mean
	- Formulas: 
		- Population z-Score
			- $$z=\frac{x-u}{\sigma}$$
			- $\text{u is the population mean}$
			- $\text{x is the data point}$
			- $\sigma \text{ is the population standard deviation}$
		- Sample z-Score
			- $$z=\frac{x-\bar{x}}{s}$$
			- $\bar{x} \text{ is the sample mean}$
			- $\text{x is the data point}$
			- $\text{s is the sample standard deviation}$
## Examples
- Example 1: Find the mean, variance and standard deviation of the following. Final grades in a geography class. Assume it is the population data.
	- 88, 56, 72, 67, 59, 48, 81, 62, 90, 75, 75, 43, 71, 64, 78, 84
	- $$\text{mean: } \frac{1116}{16}=69.2$$
	- $$\begin{array}{rrr}
x & x-u & (x-u)^2\\
88 & 18.4 & 338.56 \\
56 & 13.6 & 184.96 \\
72 & 2.4 & 5.76 \\
67 & -2.6 & 6.76 \\
59 &  -10.6 & 112.36\\
48 & -21.6 & 466.56 \\
81 & 11.4 & 129.46 \\
62 & -7.6 & 57.76 \\
90 & 20.4 & 416.16 \\
75 & 5.4 & 29.16 \\
75 & 5.4 & 29.16 \\
43 & 26.6 & 707.56 \\
71 & 1.4 & 1.96 \\
64 & -5.6 & 31.36 \\
78 & 8.4 & 70.56 \\
84 & 14.4 & 207.36
\end{array}$$
	- $$\text{total: 2795.96}$$
	- Variance
	- $$\sigma^2=\frac{\sum(x-u)^2}{N}$$
	- $$\sigma^2=\frac{2795.96}{16}=174.75$$
	- $$\sigma=\sqrt{ 174.75 }=13.22 \text{ marks}$$
	- Find the z-scores for the marks 90 and 64
		- 90:
			- $$z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$$
			- $$z=\frac{90-69.6}{13.22}$$
			- $$z=1.54$$
		- 64:
			- $$z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$$
			- $$z=\frac{64-90}{13.22}$$
			- $$-0.42$$
