## Lesson
- How you collect data is important
	- How you organize and display data helps you analyze and make inferences
	- How you summarize data determine whether you can make valid generalizations
- For example when comparing data there are different types of graphs that can be used that may emphasize different messages.
	- Multiple Bar Graphs: Different Quantities represented by different colors and lengths of bars that are placed side by side
	- Split Bar Graph (Stacked): Same as above but bars are placed on above the other
	- Relative Split Bar Graph: Same as split bar graph, but bars represent different percent's, totaling 100. 
- As a society, we collect data to acquire information.
	- It is important that the data gathered are both reliable and valid. 
	- Reliable data: Results of a study that can be duplicated in another study. Repetition of trials will produce more accurate data. 
	- Valid Data: Results that accurately represent the entire population
- It is key to perform a critical analysis of any statistical report. The following questions should be answered:
	- **How large was the sample?**
	- **Who sponsored the study?**
	- **How was the sample chosen?**
	- **What was the source of the data?**
	- **Was the data primary or secondary?** 
	- **What are the questions on the survey?**
