## Part 1: Lesson
- Often you need to determine if one variable depends on another variable. This lesson will concentrate on fitting a linear model to a scatter plot. 
	- The independent or explanatory variable is the variable on the x axis of the scatter plot
	- The dependent or response variable is the variable on the y axis of the scatter plot
- Variables that have a linear correlation have a linear equation y=ax+b to relate independent variable (x) and dependent variable y. 
- If x increases at the same rate a y increases the relation has a positive or direct correlation. An exact match of the data to a line has a correlation of 1. 
- If x increases at the same rate as y decreases the relation has a negative correlation. An exact match of the data to a line has correlation of -1
- If you are given a set of x and y values and wish to determine if a linear relation exists, the following formula will calculate the correlation coefficient: 
	- $$r=\frac{\overbrace{ n }^{ \text{number of points} }\left( \sum xy \right)-\sum x\sum y}{\sqrt{ \left[ n\sum x^2-\left( \sum x \right)^2 \right]\left[ n\sum y^2-\left( \sum y \right)^2 \right] }}$$
## Lesson Part 2:
- Linear Regression
	- Analytic technique for determining the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable.
	- Process used only if the two variables have a strong linear correlation
	- Finding the line of best fit to create a mathematical model: $y=ax+b$
	- Referred to as the least squares method.
	- Use this equation of line best fit to predict the value of one of the two variables given the value of the other variable.
- To find the equation of the line of best fit you use the following formulas
	- $$\begin{align}
\text{The equation is }y=ax+b \text{ where: } \\
a & =\frac{n\sum xy-\sum x\sum y}{\left[ n\sum x^2-\left( \sum x \right)^2 \right]} \\
\text{and} \\
b & =\bar{y}-a \bar{x}
\end{align}$$
	- Note the slope a indicates only how y varies with x on the line of best fit, it does not tell you anything about the strength of the correlation "r"
- Outliers and small sample sizes: 
	- Can seriously affect the equation of line of best fit
	- If the outlier is the result of a measurement error, eliminate the outlier to get a useful line of best fit
