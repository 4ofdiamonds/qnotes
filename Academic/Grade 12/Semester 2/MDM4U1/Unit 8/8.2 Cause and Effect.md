## Lesson
- Correlation: a relationship in which change in one variable tends to correspond with proportional change in another variable
- Causality: implies that change in one variable causes change in another variable
- Usually the main reason for a correlation study is to find evidence of a cause and effect relationship. For example, a school board may want to know whether providing breakfast programs increase student performance 
- Correlation does not imply causation 
	- Assuming a casual relationship based on strong correlation is the most common mistake in two variable data analysis
	- When designing a study of interpreting a correlation, you often need background knowledge and insight to recognize the casual relationships present 
	- Sine techniques that can help determine whether a correlation is the result of a cause and effect relationship:
		- Use sampling methods that hold the extraneous variables (external) constant
			- For example, use an experimental group and control group. These groups should be as similar as possible so that differences in dependent variables for the two groups can be attributed to the change in the independent variable
		- conduct similar investigations with different samples and check for consistency in the results
		- remove or account for possible comm-cause factors
- Types of casual relationships
	- Cause and effect: a change in x produces a change in y
		- Increase the speed of production line crease the number of items produced
			- makes sense that one causes the other
			- clearly evident that if you increase the speed of a production line, you will produce more product
	- Common cause factor: an external variable causes two variables to change in the same way
		- ice cream sales are positively correlated with heat stroke
			- lurking/hidden/extraneous variable
	- Reverse cause and effect: the dependent and independent variable are reversed
		- traffic causes car accidents
	- Accidental: correlation exists without any casual relationship
		- price of break went up at birth rate of kittens went up
	- Resumed: correlation seems logical yet no apparent common cause or cause and effect is observed
		- level and of fitness and watching adventure movies
## Examples
- Classify the likely relationship in the following situations
	- a) a patients stress level is negatively correlated with the amount of exercise performed
		- cause and effect
	- b) student math scores are positively correlated with science scores
		- common cause 
	- c) pancake sales are negatively correlated with science scores
	- d) job interview success rate is positively correlated with number of years a person has been marrie
	- e) traffic congestion has a strong correlation with the number of urban expressways
