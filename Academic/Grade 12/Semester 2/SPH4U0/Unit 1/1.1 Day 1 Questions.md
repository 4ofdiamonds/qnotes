1. When a high-speed passenger train traveling at 161 km/h rounds a bend, the engineer is shocked to see that a locomotive has improperly entered onto the track from a siding and is a distance $D=676m$ ahead. The locomotive is moving at $\frac{29mk}{h}$. The engineer of the high-speed train immediately applied the brakes.

	What must be the magnitude of the resulting constant deceleration if a collision is to be avoided?
		$D_{train}=D_{loc}+676$
		${(\frac{V_{i}+V_{f}}{2}})t=V_{f}t+676$
		${(\frac{44.7+8.05}{2}})t=8.05t+676$
		$t=36.8s$
		
		$Vi=36.67$
		$Vf=0.00$
		$D=-676$
		$a=?$
		
		$Vf^2=Vi^2+2a\Delta D$
		$0.00^2=36.67^2+2a(-676)$
		$-\frac{1344.69}{-1352}=a$
		$-0.99=a$

2. A car is stopped at a red light. The instant that light turns green, a truck goes by it, moving at a constant speed of 55 $\frac{km}{h}$. The car accelerates at a rate of $\frac{3m}{s^2}$ chasing the truck. When and where does it catch up if:

	A. The car accelerates immediately
		$\Delta D_{truck}=\Delta D_{car}$
		$1.5t_{car}^2=15.28(t_{truck})$
		$1.5t_{car}=15.28$
		$10.18=t_{car}$
	
	B. It waits 3 seconds
	
		$\Delta D_{truck}=\Delta D_{car}$
		$1.5t_{car}^2=15.28(t_{truck})$
		**Substitute Truck time with Car**
		$t_{truck}=t_{car}+3$
		$1.5t_{car}^2=15.28(t_{car}+3)$
		$1.5t^2_{car}-15.28_{car}-45.84=0$
		$t_{car}=12.61$

3. A rock is dropped into a deep well. Ten seconds later the sound from splash is heard by the person dropping the rock. 
	 Determine the depth of the well.
		Variables:
			$Vi_{rock}=0$
			$a_{rock}=9.8$
			$Vi_{sound}=\frac{350m}{s}$
			$a_{sound}=0$
			$t=10$
			$\Delta D=?$
		Rock:
			$d=4.9t^2_{rock}$
		Sound: 
			$d=350t_{sound}$
		Time:
			$10-t_{rock}=t_{sound}$
		Time of Rock:
			$350(10-t_{rock})=4.9t^2_{rock}$
			$0=4.9t^2_{rock}-350(10-t_{rock})$
			$0=4.9t_{rock}^2-350t_{rock}-3500$
			$t_{rock}=8.89s$
