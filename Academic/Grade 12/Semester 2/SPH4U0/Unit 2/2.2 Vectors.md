 - 1. An airplane flying at an speed of airspeed of 700km/h maintains a heading of N20E. If the winds are from the west at 200 km/h determine the airplanes velocity with respect to the ground. 
	- $$pVg=pVa+aVg$$
	- $$pVg=[70, 700\text{km/h}]+[0, 200\text{km/h}]$$
	- $$pVg=[239.41, 657.78]+[200, 0]$$
	- $$pVg=[439.41, 657.78]$$
	- $$pVg=[791.04, 56.25^\circ]$$
- 2. An airplane with an airspeed of 1000km/h wishes to fly to an airport 800km away in the NE direction. The winds are at 300km/h, E20S. How long will the flight take and what heading should the pilot use. 
	- Components
		- $$pVg=pVa+aVg$$
		- $$t=\frac{d}{v}$$
- 3. A river flows East at 3m/s. A boat is moving at (10m/s, N30E) with respect to the water. How long will it take to cross the 100m wide river and how far downstream will it end up.
	- $$d=vt$$
	- $$bVg=bVw+wVg$$
	- $$bVg=(5, 8.66)+(3, 0)$$
	- $$bVg=(8, 8.66)$$
	- $$100=8.66t$$
	- $$11.54=t$$
- How far Downstream will it end up
	- $$d=vt$$
	- $$d=8\times 11.54$$
	- $$d=92.32$$
