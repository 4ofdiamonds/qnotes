	- $$100N>58.8N$$
	- $$Fa>Ff$$

		- $$10(9.8)(0.4)=40a$$
		- $$a=0.98$$
- 3. An inventive child wants to reach an apple in a tree without climbing the tree. Sitting in a chair connected to a rope that passes over a frictionless pulley, the child pulls on the loose end of the rope with such a force that the spring scale reads 250N. The child's true weight is 320N, and the chairs weight is 160N. The child's feet are not touching the ground.
	- a) Show that the acceleration of the system is upward

		- $$F=83.38$$
- 4. A box of mass m initially at rest is acted upon by a constant applied force of magnitude Fa. The friction between the box and the horizontal surface can be assumed to be negligible, but the box is subject to drag force of magnitude kv where v is the speed of the box and k is a positive constant.

	- a) The dot below represents the box. Draw and label the forces (not components) that act on the box. ![[Drawing 2025-04-07 00.13.17.excalidraw]]
	- b) Write, but do not solve, a differential equation that could be used to determine the speed of v of the box as a function of time t.

		- $$ma=Fa-Fd$$
		- $$m \frac{dv}{dt}=Fa-kv$$

			- $$Fc=111$$
			- At the bottom of the Ferris wheel
			- $$Fc=Fn-Fg$$
			- $$111=Fn-667$$

			- $$111=\frac{mv^2}{r}$$
			- $$111=\frac{m}{r}v^2$$

			- $$\frac{Fc}{4}=\frac{m}{r}v^2$$
			- $$\frac{Fc_{new}}{4}=Fc$$
			- $$Fc_{new}=Fc\cdot 4$$
			- $$Fc_{new}=444$$
			- $$Fc=Fn-Fg$$
			- $$444=Fn-667$$
