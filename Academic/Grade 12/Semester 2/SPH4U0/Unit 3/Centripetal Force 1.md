## Lesson
- Review
	- Always towards the Centre $$a_{c}=\frac{v^2}{r}=4\pi^2rf^2=\frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}$$
	- In hertz$$f=\text{frequency}=\frac{\text{number of rotations}}{\text{total time}} $$
	- $$T=\frac{1}{f}$$
## Questions
- 1. A rock is placed on a turntable rotated at 30rpm. The radius is 20cm. Determine the minimum coefficient of static friction required in order for the rock to not fly off
	- Variables
		- $\mu = ?$
		- $r = 20$
		- $f=0.5$
	- Equations
		- $$f=ma$$
		- $$\left( 4\pi^2rf^2 \right)-\mu(9.8)$$
		- $${4\pi^{2}0.20(0.5)^{2}}=\mu 9.8$$
		- $$\frac{4\pi^{2}0.20(0.5)^{2}}{9.8}=\mu$$
		- $$0.2=\mu$$
- 2. A giant cylinder (r=5m) is rotated at 20rpm. A passenger gets stuck to the outside will. Determine mu minimum for a successful ride. 
- 3. A pilot performs a loop de loop maneuver of radius 50m at a constant speed of 360km/h. If the pilot is sitting in a scale, determine the scale reading at the top and bottom of the loop. M=50kg
