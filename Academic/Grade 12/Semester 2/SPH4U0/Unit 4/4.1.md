## Lesson
- If we work hard then our energy level is low
- $$W=\Delta E$$
- $$W=\int F \cdot dx$$
- $$W=\vec{F} \cdot \Delta \vec{d}=F\Delta \cos \theta$$
- Equations
	- Gravitational$$Eg=mgh$$
	- Kinetic$$E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
	- Spring$$E=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
- Conservation of Energy
	- $$E_{total}+W=E_{total}$$
	- where$$E_{total}=E_{k}+E_{g}+E_{s}$$
	- $$W_{friction}=F_{f}\Delta \cos180$$
- Power: rate at which work is done or energy is consumed. Measured in watt
	- $$1w=1\frac{J}{s}$$
- $$P_{ave}=\frac{\Delta w}{\Delta t}$$
- $$P_{inst}=\frac{dw}{dt}$$
## Examples
- 1. A 10kj mass slides, down a 30 degree, 10m long incline. If the force of friction is 20N, determine its speed at the bottom of the ramp. 
	- $$E_{total}+W=E_{total}$$
	- $$\frac{1}{2}mv^2-f_{f}\Delta d\cos 180=10\sin 30$$
- 3. The force acting on a 2kj object is F=-6x (as it moves along the x-axis) at x=3.0 the velocity is 8m/s 
	- a) Find v at x=4.0m
		-      
	- b) For what x value will the object have a velocity of 5m/s
