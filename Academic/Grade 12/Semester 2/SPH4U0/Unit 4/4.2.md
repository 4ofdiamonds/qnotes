- 1. A 1kg mass is attached to a spring suspended from a ceiling. The spring stretches 0.2m and comes to rest.
	- a) Find the spring constant
		- $$Fs=Fg$$
		- $$kx=mg$$
		- $$k=49N$$
	- b) Find the potential energy stored in the spring at this point
		- $$E_{s}=\frac{1}{2}kx^2=\frac{1}{2}49(0.2)^2$$
		- $$\frac{1}{2}49x^2=\frac{1}{2}49(0.2)^2=0.98J$$
		- c) The spring is pulled down an additional 0.2 m and set into gentle oscillation. Find the speed of the mass and its acceleration at the bottom of its swing. 
			- $$v=0$$
			- $$ma=kx-mg$$
			- $$a=\frac{kx-mg}{m}$$
			- $$a=\frac{49(0.4)-1(9.8)}{1}$$
		- d) Repeat "c" for the mass being at the top of its swing.
			- $$a=\frac{49(0)-1(9.8)}{1}$$
			- $$v=0,a=-9.8$$
		- e) Repeat "c" for the mass being 0.1m from the bottom of its motion and moving down
			- $$E_{k_{a}}+E_{g_{a}}+E_{s_{a}}=E_{k_{b}}+E_{g_{b}}+E_{s_{b}}$$

- Calculus
	- $$ma=\sum f$$
	- $$m\frac{dv}{dt}=\sum f$$
	- $$m\frac{dv}{dx}\cdot \frac{dx}{dt}=kx-mg$$
	- $$\int _{v_{i}}^vmv(dv)=\int _{x_{i}}^xkx-mg(dx)$$
	- $$\frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{1}{2}mv^2_{i}=\frac{1}{2}kx^2-\frac{1}{2}kx^2_{i}-mgx-mgx_{i}$$
	- $$m(v^2-v_{i}^2)=k(x^2-x_{i}^2)-2mg(\Delta x)$$
	- $$m(v^2-v_{i}^2)=k(x^2-x_{i}^2)-2mg(\Delta x)$$
