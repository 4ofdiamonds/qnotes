## Lesson
- Torque
	- Twisting affect of a force
	- $$\begin{align}
\vec{\tau} & =\vec{r} \times \vec{F} \\
\vec{\tau} & =rF\sin \theta
\end{align}$$
- Right hand rule
	- Put vectors tail to tail
	- Fingers indirection and r and curl them toward F
	- Thumb gives you torque direction out of page means direction of rotation or axis through which rotation will occur
## Examples
- A 10m long, 200kg beam hangs over the edge of a building (overhang is 4m). How far can Andrew (m=80kg) walk along the beam before it tips? ![[Drawing 2025-05-05 10.49.17.excalidraw]]
	- $$\begin{align}
\sum \vec{\tau_{p}} & =0 \\
cw \vec{\tau}  & = ccw \vec{\tau} \\
Fg_{\text{andrew}}(r)(\sin 90) & =(Fg_{beam})(1)(\sin 90) \\
(80)(9.8)(r) & =(200)(9.8)(1) \\
r & =2.5 \text{m}
\end{align}$$
