## Lesson: Magnetism/Electromagnetism
- Lodestone (Fe2O3) was found to possess magnetic properties in 6th century BC in the province of magnesia (Asia Minor)
- Law of Magnets: Opposite poles attract while similar ones repel
- Mapping magnetic Fields

- Electromagnetism
	- Oersted (1820)
	- He noticed that when current (I) was passed through a wire compasses would realign themselves indicating the presence of a magnetic field
	- Right hand rule: 
		- 1. RHR for a straight conductor: ![[Drawing 2025-06-02 10.49.42.excalidraw]]
		- 2. RHR for a coil: Fingers point in direction of current, thumb points to north![[Drawing 2025-06-02 10.53.29.excalidraw]]
		- 3. Motor Principle: A current carrying conductor is an external magnetic field experiences a force. Fingers point south, thumb points in direction of current, open palm tells force direction ![[Drawing 2025-06-02 11.03.05.excalidraw]]
