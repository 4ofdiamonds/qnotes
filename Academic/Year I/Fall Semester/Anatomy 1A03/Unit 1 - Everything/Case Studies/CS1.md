CASE STUDY 1
After struggling to conceive, Sara completed a round of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and found out she is pregnant with twins. During a routine ultrasound test is was discovered that the twins shared an amniotic sac. Sara didnâ€™t understand the significance of this, but after the twins were born she wanted to know if they were identical or fraternal.
1. In terms of the steps of fertilization and implantation, what is the difference between the two types of twins?
	- The twins would have had the same fertilization process and initial implantation. After the initial implantation the embryonic disk would have had to create the two different twins
2. Based on the ultrasound which type of twins does Sara have? How did you come to this conclusion?
	- Most likely identical as the twins would share the same DNA if they are in the same blastocyst. It would be almost impossible for the twins to be in the same amniotic disk and not come from the same embryonic disk
3. Based on all this information, around what day in development do you think the twins first formed?
	- I would guess possibly around the time of the creation of the primitive streak because that's when the fetus starts to gain definition and before that they fetus is just a mass of cells
