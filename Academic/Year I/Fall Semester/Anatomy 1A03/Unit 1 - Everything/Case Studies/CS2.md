Case # 2
Zuri is 3 months old and is proving to be a handful for her mom Amari. She is either asleep or very irritable. Also, she does not feed well and vomits often. Amari knew Zuri’s head measured large in utero and at birth and had been on the lookout for these types of symptoms. A scan revealed a narrowing of the cerebral aqueduct and enlarged ventricles.
- 1) Knowing the circulation of CSF around the brain, which ventricles would be enlarged given the location of the narrowing?
	- The **cerebral aqueduct** connects the **third ventricle** to the **fourth ventricle**.
	- If it is narrowed/blocked, CSF cannot flow forward from the lateral and third ventricles into the fourth ventricle.
- 2) What is the name of the condition Zuri developed?
	- **hydrocephalus**
 - 3) Explain why Zuri’s head measured large at birth and why this might not happen if this condition developed in an adult?
	- In infants, the cranial sutures and fontanelles are not yet fused. Increased CSF pressure causes the head to **expand outward**, leading to an enlarged head circumference.
	- In adults, the cranial sutures are fused, so the skull cannot expand. Instead, increased CSF causes **intracranial pressure to rise**, which can lead to headaches, vision problems, or brain damage, but not head enlargement.
- 4) Knowing that the cerebral aqueduct is blocked, which structures (in order starting at the cerebral aqueduct ending at the blood) would have a reduced flow of CSF?
	- Cerebral aqueduct → **Fourth ventricle** → **Median/lateral apertures and central canal** → **Subarachnoid space** → **Arachnoid granulations** → **Superior sagittal sinus (venous blood)**.
- 5) What is a common treatment for this type of condition?
	- The most common treatment is insertion of a **ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt**.
	    - This diverts excess CSF from the ventricles into the peritoneal cavity, where it can be absorbed.   
	- Another treatment option is an **endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV)**, which creates an alternate pathway for CSF flow.
