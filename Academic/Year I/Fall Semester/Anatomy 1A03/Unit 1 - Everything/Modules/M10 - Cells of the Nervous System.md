# M10 - Cells of the Nervous System
# Structure of a Neuron
## Cells of Nervous System
- **Neurons**: Receive and and transmit action potentials
	- **Cell Body**: contains the nucleus
	- **Dendrites**: acts as the input
	- **Axon**: acts as the output
- **Neuroglia**: Support and protect neurons but dont generate action potentials themselves

## Neurons
- **axoplasm**: cytoplasm of the axon
- **axolemma**: plasma membrane of the axon
- **Collateral axons**: transmit action potential to other areas
- **Schwann cells**: Wrap itself around the neuron to create the myelin sheath and full wrap around the axon

## Axonal Transport
- Axons will also create vesicles which store neurotransmitters in the presynaptic terminals (synaptic vesicles)
- **Axonal Transport**: neurotransmitters will be produced in the cell body and are transported to the up or down the axon. The neurotransmitter can either inhibit or stimulate the postsynaptic cell
- Viruses an actually use this nerves axonal transport to get into the CNS (rabes, herpres)
# Types of Neurons and Cells of the CNS
## Types of Neurons
### Functional
- **Sensory/afferent**: action potentials toward the CNS
- **Motor/efferent**: action potentials away from the CNS
- **Interneurons/association neurons**: within CNS from one neuron to another (decision neurons)
### Structural
**Multipolar**: Many dendrites and single dendrite. This is most neurons in the CNS and motor neurons
**Bipolar**: Single Dendrite and single axon. Mostly found in sensory organs like the eyes
**Pseudo-Unipolar (or unipolar)**: Sensory receptors on the end of the cell which pick up sensory information which will bring the information back into the ganglion and CNS

## Supporting Cells of the Nervous System
- **Neuroglia**: supporting cells of the nervous system. They account for 50% of the weight of the brain
	- 4 types of neuroglia in the CNS
	- 2 types of neuroglia in the PNS
### Astrocytes
- Largest and most numerous
- Cytoplasmic projections branch to form the foot processes which cover the surfaces of blood vessels and neurons
- Chemicals are released to form tight junctions between endothelial cells of capillaries.
- These characteristics allow it to form the blood brain barrier which protects against toxic substances
- They also help with the formation of synapses

### Ependymal cells
- Lines the ventricles of the brain and central canal in the spinal cord which forms the choroid plexus which will produce the cerebral spinal fluid
- The cilia will help to move the CSF through the ventricles

### Microglia
- They are specialized macrophages which digest invaders in the CNS through phagocytic inflammation
- They get rid of anything that doesn't need to be there

### Oligodendrocytes
- Wrap around multiple nerves to form the myelin sheaths in the CNS and increase conduction

# Cells of the PNS and Gray vs White matter
## Supporting cells of the PNS
### Schwann Cells
- Wraps around the axon multiple times to insulate it with many phospholipid bilayers and form the myelin sheath. This will help to move action potential faster
- During the wrapping process the cytoplasm is pushed to the edges

### Satellite Cells
- Flattened cells that surround the neuron cell bodies in the ganglia
- Act as protection and support for the cell bodies
## Myelinated and Unmyelinated 
- Myelin: Protects and insulates axons from on another
- Unmyelinated: conduct signals more rapidly. The axons will push into the a single Schwann cell to provide minor protection

## Myelination of Neurons
![[Pasted image 20250926124352.png]]
## Organization of Nervous Tissues in the CNS
- **Tract**: Bundle of myelinated axons in the CNS
- **Nucleus**: Collection of neuron cell bodies in the CNS
- **White matter**: myelinated axons. Nerve tracts transfer action potential from one area of the CNS to the other
- **Gray matter**: unmyelinated axons, cell bodies, dendrites, neuroglia, decision and lots of synapses
## Gray Matter vs White Matter
- In the spinal cord white is outer and gray is deeper
- In the brain the gray matter is the outside and the white matter is deeper
