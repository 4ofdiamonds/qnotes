# Brain Gross Anatomy
## Brain and Cranial Nerves
- This is an **inferior view of the brain** (from the bottom) which is evident due to the visible presence of the:
	- **Brain stem**
	- **Cerebellum**
	- **Cranial nerves**

## Brain: Gross Anatomy
### Brainstem
- connects spinal cord to brain; **integration of reflexes** (unconscious functions) that are **key for survival** (cardiovascular, digestion, etc). 
- There **exist backup systems** that rely on hormones for control for most of the main systems vital for survival
### Cerebellum
- Posterior to, and branches off from the brain stem and is split into a left and right hemisphere
- Contains 10% of the brains mass, but 50% of the brains neurons due to its extensive folding.
- Involved in control of **locomotion, balance, and posture**, and works with the cerebrum for skeletal muscle control. 
- It does not send the inputs, but mediates or interferes with them and also uses previous experiences to make the output smoother and more controlled
### Diencephalon
- Deep within the brain and sits on top of the brainstem
- Associated with regulatory functions and acts as the nervous system connection to the endocrine system
- It is composed of the thalamus, epithalamus, hypothalamus, subthalamus
- Involved in regulatory functions such as the day/night cycle, mood and emotions, or hunger and thirst. Also contains a relay center for sensory input and output
### Cerebrum
- Higher order brain functions and executive functions such as planning, reasoning, analyzing, storing, perceiving and interpreting, and coordinating motor function. 
## Principal Parts of the Brain

# Meninges & Ventricles
## Protection
- **Cranial Bones**: The brain is protect by 8 cranial bones
- **Cranial Meninges**: Pia, Arachnoid, and dura mater where the cranial dura mater is composed of 2 layers
- **Cerebrospinal fluid**: Circulates around the brain to protect it
## Meninges
- **Skull**
- **Dura Matter**: Composed of two tissues of dense irregular connective tissue. When the two layers come to a deep groove in the brain the periosteal dura will separate from the meningeal dura and creates a space called a longitudinal fissure
	- **Periosteal Dura**: Seen throughout the body but is highly associated with the meningeal dura
	- **Meningeal Dura**: Connects with periosteal dura to make one functional layer
- **Dural Venous sinus (superior sagittal sinus)**: Made between the Dural layers and carries venous blood away the brain (there are no veins that go to the brain)
- **Falx Cerebri**: Is the anchor point in the folds of the meninges between the superior sagittal sinus
- **Subdural space**: the space between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater and contains serous fluid
- **Arachnoid mater**: Thin layer of weblike structures
- **Subarachnoid space**: where the weblike projections come through and is filled with cerebral spinal fluid
- **Pia mater**: closely adheres to every bump and groove on the brain

## Ventricles
- **Lateral ventricles**: Separated into the Anterior horn, inferior horn and posterior horn. This is where CSF is first produced
- **Interventricular foramen**: A space that runs from the floor of the lateral ventricle to the roof of the third ventricle
- **Third ventricle**: Surrounds the Diencephalon
- **Cerebral aqueduct**: Runs through the brainstem and ends at the fourth ventricle
- **Fourth ventricle**: Where the pons comes in contact with the cerebellum
- The space on the inside of the neural tube becomes the ventricles as well as the central canal of the spinal cord
- All the ventricles are lined with ependymal cells which produce the CSF, but most of it is made in the lateral
- In the 4th ventricle there are three apertures (median and 2 lateral) which allow for the CSF to enter into the subarachnoid space

# CSF Production and Flow
## Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)
- **CSF**: A portion of our blood that is serum like but lacking proteins (just the plasma portion of the blood which is missing proteins and clotting factors). Contains lots of glucose
- The CSF is used for nutrient and gas exchange, bathes and protects the CNS, and shock absorption and optimal chemical environment for the brain
- **Choroid plexus**: Specialized ependymal cells which stick out into an area of capillaries and filter out through things across the membrane

## Cerebrospinal Fluid Flow
- Always moves from higher pressure to lower pressure
- It will always be at its lowest pressure where it exists the system at the top
- **Arachnoid Granulations**: Regions of the Arachnoid mater which allows the CSF to enter back into the blood supply
- All the blood from the superior sagittal sinus will collect the venous blood in various parts of the brain and comes around back to the cranial cavity and merge with the internal jugular vein.
