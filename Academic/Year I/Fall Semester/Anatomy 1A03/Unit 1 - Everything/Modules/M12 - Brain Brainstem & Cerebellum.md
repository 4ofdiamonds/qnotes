# Medulla Oblongata
### Medulla Oblongata
- Primarily transmits ascending and descending impulses between the brain and spinal cord
- Center for vital reflexes
- **Spinal Nerve C1**: The last spinal nerve moving upwards
- **PYRAMIDS**: Bilateral white mater bulges on the anterior side of the Medulla Oblongata and have descending tracts (information from the brain to the spinal cord) which carry motor information to the skeletal muscles.
- **Decussation of the pyramids**: Right before they enter the spinal chord the pyramids will cross over which is why the controls of the brain hemispheres are flipped
- **Olive**: A bundle of nuclei which relay information from the joints and periphery to the cerebellum. Also found in sound perception
- **Cranial Nerves (Hypoglossal XII nerve)**: The cell bodies are located in the medulla (Hypoglossal Nucleus)
- Contains the cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X, XI, XII

# Pons, Midbrain & Reticular Formation
## Pons
- Superior to the Medulla
- Contains Ascending and Descending nerve tracts
- Contains grey matter (nuclei)
- Sleep center (REM sleep), respiratory center
- Anterior Region
	- **Pontine Nuclei**: communication between cerebrum and cerebellum
- Posterior Region
	- Nuclei of cranial nerves V, VI, VII, VIII

## Midbrain
- Most superior portion of the brainstem
- Contains white and grey mater
- Acts as a connection to the thalamus
- Contains visual and auditory reflex centers
- Nuclei of cranial nerves III, IV, V
- **Tectum**: 4 nuclei, form mounds on the dorsal surface of the midbrain (2 superior colliculi, 2 inferior colliculi)
	- **Superior Colliculi**: Visual reflexes (movements of muscles of the eye - tracking and scanning)
	- **Inferior Colliculi**: Auditory reflexes
- **Cerebellar Peduncle**: are bundles of white matter carrying axons 
	- **Superior**: From midbrain -> cerebellum
	- **Middle**: From pons -> cerebellum
	- **Inferior**: Medulla -> cerebellum

## Reticular Formation
- Group of nuclei scattered throughout the brainstem, connected by white matter and forms a cloud. Controls the sleep-wake cycle. 
# Cerebellum
## The Cerebellum
- **Arbor Vitae**: The tree like branching of white matter
- **Folia**: Folds in the gray matter cortex region
- Divisions of the cerebellum
	- **Lateral Hemisphere**: The cerebellum are split into two lateral hemispheres
	- **Vermis**: A structure which divides the hemispheres
	- **Anterior Lobes**: The very top of the cerebellum
	- **Posterior Lobe**: The back of the cerebellum
	- **Primary fissure**: A line on the cerebellum which separates the two lobes
	- **Flocculonodular Lobes**: A lobe which sits outside the hemispheres

### Communication with other regions of the CNS
- 3 Regions
	- 1. Flocculonodular lobe - Takes all sorts of information to figure out balance
	- 2. Vermis - Gross motor coordination (Anterior), fine motor coordination (posterior)
	- 3. Cerebellar (lateral) hemisphere - fine motor coordination
