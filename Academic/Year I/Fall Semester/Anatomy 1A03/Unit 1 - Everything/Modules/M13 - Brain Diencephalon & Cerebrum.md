# Thalamus
## The Diencephalon

![[Pasted image 20251003052104.png]]
## Thalamus
- Composed of two masses of gray matter connected to each other by the interthalamic adhesion and is surrounded by the third ventricle
- The gray matter mass had different areas of nuclei
	- **Medial Geniculate Nucleus**: Auditory impulses
	- **Lateral Geniculate Nucleus**: Visual impulses
- The CSF is running in between the Thalamus 
- The pineal gland is located in between the Thalamus
![[Pasted image 20251003052747.png]]
- Largest part of the diencephalon
- Receives a major portion of sensory input - projections to cerebral cortex (exception is sense of smell)
- It helps to sort out the sensory input so the cerebral cortex does not need to process as much
# Subthalamus, Epithalamus & Hypothalamus
## Subthalamus
- Inferior to the thalamus
- Has both ascending and descending nerve tracts and is primarily white matter
- **Subthalamic nuclei**: involved in controlling motor function with some other areas in the cerebrum. Grey mater areas near the diencephalon

## Epithalamus
- Poster and superior to the thalamus
- Made up of two portions
	- **Habenula**: Superior portion. Involved in motivational control of behavior. Integrative role linked to behaviors that involves rewards. Involved in emotional control and has to do with decision making and link behaviors that involve rewards. Integrates sensory, cognitive and emotional states.
	- **Pineal Gland**: Inferior portion. secretes melatonin; may influence the onset of puberty. Is connected to the sleep wake cycle.

## Hypothalamus
- Most inferior portion of the diencephalon
- **Infundibulum**: connecting stalk to the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland which is the master gland and secretes hormones relating to everything. This is made of white mater and creates a connection between the nervous and endocrine system.
- Has many clusters of nuclei that control bodily functions. Know that there are more than 12 different nuclei and they low key do everything. An example is thermoregulation
- **Optic Chiasm**: where the visual information from the eyes transfers to
- Since all the nuclei are so close to each other in the hypothalamus, sometimes our emotions will trigger some of the other nuclei and explains the connection between certain behaviors
- Also plays a role in visceral and emotional responses to odors

# Cerebrum
## Cerebrum
- **Cerebral Cortex**: outer layer of gray matter
- Also has deep clusters of nuclei
- **Basal Nuclei**: functionally related nuclei that control motor function
- **Cerebral Medulla**: White matter which connects gray matter regions to each other and the cerebrum to other regions of the brain

## Cerebral Cortex
- **Gyrus**: the folds on an upward angle
- **Sulcus**: the grooves formed by the folds
- **Fissures**: deeper folding in the cerebrum
- **Longitudinal fissure**: separates the brain into left and right halves
![[Pasted image 20251003061357.png]]
- **Frontal Lobe**: motor function, aggression and mood
- **Precentral gyrus**: location of the primary motor cortex. This is where the majority of motor signals are initiated
- **Central Sulcus**: separates the brain into the frontal and parietal lobe
- **Postcentral gyrus**: primary somatosensory cortex where most of the sensory information is sent for interpretation
- **Parietal Lobe**: touch, pressure, blood pH, most sensory except smell, taste, vision and hearing
- **Parietal occipital sulcus**: separates the parietal and occipital lobe
- **Occipital lobe**: reception and integration of visual input
- **Lateral cerebral sulcus or lateral fissure**: separates the temporal from everything else
- **Temporal lobe**: olfactory, auditory input, memory
- **Insula Lobe**: taste, homeostasis, self awareness and emotion

## Cerebral Medulla
- Connects the areas of the cortex to other parts of the CNS through white mater nerve tracts
- **Association fibers (tracts)**: connect areas of cerebral cortex within the same hemisphere
- **Commissural fibers (tracts)**: connects the cerebral hemispheres to form the corpus callosum
- **Projection fibers (tracts)**: between the cerebrum and other parts of the brain and spinal cords to form the internal capsule
