# Introduction
## Cranial Nerves
- Cranial nerves are part of the PNS but has **cell bodies in the brain** which differentiates them from spinal nerves (exception is XI which originates in the spinal cord and brain)
- Numbered I-XII moving from **anterior to posterior** in the brain (reversed with XI and XII)
	- One pair comes from the cerebrum (I)
	- One pair comes from the diencephalon (II)
	- Nine pairs from the brain stem
	- One pair from the spinal cord (XI)
- The functions can be sensory only, motor only, or mixed.
	- Can also be general senses or specialized senses
	- Can be for skeletal muscle or parasympathetic function
- Mnemonics:
	- OOOTTAFVGVAH
	- SSMMBMBSBBMM

## What do you need to know?
- Location
- Nerve Name and Number
- Motor, Sensory or Both
- General Function
- Where the nerve originates
# Cranial Nerves
## Olfactory, I
- Sensory - Function: Smell
- Two neuron system where the smell receptors from the nose bring the signal to the olfactory bulb, then to the olfactory tract, then to the temporal lobe

## Optic, II
- Sensory - Function: Vision

## Oculomotor, III
- Motor* - Functions: 
	- Somatic motor - movements of the eyeball and upper eyelid
	- Parasympathetics motor - pupil contractions, muscles to focus lens
- * all somatic motor nerves have a sensory component for proprioception
- **Proprioception**: tension and position of skeletal muscles

## Trochlear, IV
- Motor - Function: Movement of the eyeball
- Named after the Trochlear muscle which (white structure)

## Trigeminal, V
- Sensory/Motor
- 3 Branches
	- **Ophthalmic**: Sensory - Function: upper facial structure
	- Maxillary: Sensory - Function: middle facial structure
	- Mandibular: Sensory - Function: lower facial structures & anterior to ear
- **Mastication**: Motor - Function: Chewing process

## Abducens, VI
- Motor - Function: Lateral movement of the eyeball

## Facial, VII
- Sensory/Motor - Functions:
	- Sensory: Taste
	- Motor: Facial Expression
	- Parasympathetic Motor: Salivary/lacrimal glands

## Vestibulocochlear, VIII
- Sensory - Function: Hearing/Balance
- Two nerves coming together
	- **Vestibular Nerve**: Sense of balance
	- **Cochlear Nerve**: Special sense of hearing

## Glossopharyngeal, IX
- Sensory/Motor - Function:
	- Sensory: Taste; monitors swallowing muscles, blood pressure, blood gases (receives signals from specialized receptors in the blood vessels)
	- Motor: swallowing
	- Parasympathetic motor: parotid gland (saliva)

## Vagus, X
- Sensory/Motor - Functions:
	- Sensory: BP/blood gases, taste, also connects to organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavity
	- Motor: voice production, swallowing
	- Parasympathetic motor: GI control, respiration, lowers HR

## Accessory, XI
- Motor - Functions: Head movements 
- Connects with the Vagus nerve
