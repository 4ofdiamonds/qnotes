## Electrical Nature of Neurons
- Electrical properties result from **ionic concentration differences** across plasma membrane and **permeability of membrane**
- Charge differences between the inside and outside of a membrane due to ionic concentration differences across the plasma membrane. 
- Concentration and Ion gradients can be set up through protein channels and active transport

- By separating anions and cations, we are able to create electrical force buildup on either side
- The attraction between the negative and positive is known as the voltage. (outside is positive, inside is negative)
- Separation of charge = potential difference or **membrane potential**
- The voltage of a resting axon is **-70 mV**
# Na+/K+ pump & Membrane Permeability
## Resting Potential of the Membrane
- **Resting Membrane Potential**: The voltage difference across a membrane while the cell is not sending an electrical signal
- Concentration "Highlights"
	- Extracellular Fluid: 
		- Chloride (Cl-)
		- Sodium (Na+)
		- Calcium (Ca2+)
	- Intracellular Fluid: 
		- Potassium (K+)
		- Proteins (anions)
- On the immediate inside and immediate outside is where there is a big ion difference which sets up the membrane potential
- The concentration gradient is set up through the sodium potassium pump and membrane permeability

## Sodium-potassium (Na+/K+) pump
- Sets up the gradient by actively transporting 2 K+ in and 3 Na+ out

## Membrane Permeability
### Ion channels
- **Leak (nongates) ion channels**: always open and move from high->low concentration which are specific per molecule (lots of potassium leaks)
- **Gated ion channels**: open and close on demand
	- **Ligand-gated**: opens when a chemical signal binds
	- **Mechanically-gated**: physically opening the gates
	- **Voltage-gated**: opens under certain voltage changes
### Permeability
- The number of gated channels and the amount of those that are open will affect movement of ions
- Size of ions affects what can and cant leave the cell (example proteins cant leave easily)
# Establishing the Resting Potential
## Establishing Resting Potential
- The potassium ions will leave the cell and create a positive charge outside the cell which will cause the negative anions to be drawn to the cell membrane
- This will create a negative charge on the inside of the membrane which will attract the potassium ions back into the cell
- Resting membrane potential is reached when the amount of potassium drawn out by the concentration gradient is equal to the amount of potassium drawn back in by the ion gradient

- Generally the movement of the molecule will be with the concentration gradient most of the time
- Certain tissues will have more potassium channels which will increase the resting potential to 90mV
- The potential is not based on the flow but just the concentration of charge
