# Gate-Ion Channels
## Electrical Signals in Neurons
- An electrical signal is propagated through a change in membrane potential which is done through gated ion channels
### Ligand-Gated Channel
- Responds to a ligand which binds to a receptor
- The ligands are channel specific
- Found in dendrite regions

### Mechanically Gated Channels
- Responds to pressure or vibration
- Associated with special sensory regions

### Voltage-Gated Channels
- Responds to change in membrane potential
- Found in the axon region of the neurons (sodium and potassium)

# Graded Potentials
## Electrical Signals in Neurons
### Graded Potentials
- Communication over only short distances
- Uses ligand and mechanically gated channels
- Very dependent on how much of a stimulus is produced because the ligand will determine the amount of voltage change
### Action Potentials
- Communication over short and long distances
- Uses voltage gated channels
- Only the first voltage gated ion channel is required to go off to trigger the rest
## Local or Graded Potentials
- Occur in the cell body or dendrite regions which is where the ligand and mechanical gated channels are.
### When a channel opens
- Small deviations from resting potential
- **Depolarization**: When a channel opens and the potential moves closer to 0 (-70 to -60). This can happen with the opening of a sodium channel
- **Hyperpolarization**: A channel opens and the potential moves away from 0 (-70 to -75). This can happen with the opening of a potassium or chloride channel

## Graded Potentials: Stimulus Strength & Summation
- The amplitude of the graded potential is based on the stimulus strength (pressure or amounts of ligand)
- **Summation**: Signals that are triggered rapidly will add together to change the potential more
- Large graded potentials are needed to make action potentials

# Action Potential
## Action Potential
- Once a graded potential reaches a depolarization threshold it will propagate an action potential
- The change must be great enough that it reaches the trigger zone. The trigger zone has an high concentration of voltage gated channels
- Depolarization is followed by repolarization, then restore the membrane potential
- All-or-none principle
- All the voltages will reach the same values because the voltage gated proteins all activate at those specific voltages

## Voltage-Gated Ion Channels & the Action Potential
- Potassium Gates: Fully closed during resting potential
- Sodium Gates: The cytosol end (inactivation) is open but the extracellular gate (activation gate) is closed

## Depolarizing Phase of Action Potential
- After the graded potential reaches threshold, the sodium gates will open and sodium will rush into the cell \
- The potassium gates open much more slowely
![[Pasted image 20251010080705.png]]
## Repolarizing Phase Begins
- Once 35mV is reached the inactivation gate will close on the sodium channels
- The potassium gates will start to open more rapidly and will bring the cell back to resting potential

## Repolarizing Phase ends and Afterpotential
### End of Repolarizing Phase
- The sodium gates activation gate will close and the inactivation gate will open
- Potassium outflow returns membrane potential back to -70mV
![[Pasted image 20251010080945.png]]
### Afterpotential (after-hyperpolarizing phase)
- If enough potassium leaves the cell, it will cause a hyperpolarization
- membrane potential drops to -90mV
## Return to Resting Membrane Potential
- Potassium channels close
- Sodium Potassium pump will bring resting membrane potential back to 70mV
# Refractory Period & Stimulus Strength
## Refractory Period of Action Potential
- After an action potential, the membrane is less sensitive to another stimulus
- **Absolute Refractory**: 
	- even max stimulus will not begin another AP
	- the sodium gate must return to the resting state in order to activate another AP
- **Relative Refractory**
	- A suprathreshold stimulus will start an AP
	- During the hyperpolarization phase you require a stronger stimulus to get back to threshold
	- K channels open but Na channels are closed

## Action Potentials: Stimulus Strength
- Stimulus strength interpreted by the brain is determined by the frequency of action potentials until the max rate is reached
- Larger stimuli will simply trigger the neuron multiple times
