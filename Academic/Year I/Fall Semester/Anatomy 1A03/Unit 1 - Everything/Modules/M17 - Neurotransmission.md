# M17 - Neurotransmission
# Continuous & Saltatory Connection
## Propagation of Action Potentials
- **Nerve Impulse**: the self propagation of an action potential across a nerve membrane. This is triggered by depolarization which opens voltage gated ion channels across the membrane

## Types of Propagation - Unmyelinated Axons
### Unmyelinated Axon
- **Continuous Conduction**: action potentials occur at one spot in the membrane, but can propagate by **stimulating adjacent regions**. Action potentials also **spread in one direction only**
- **Local Current**: Refers to the movement of positive ions. 
- The absolute refractory period is stopping the action potential from propagating backwards

## Types of Propagation - Myelinated Axons
### Myelinated Axon
- **Saltatory Conduction**: Action potential conducted from one node of Ranvier to another
- Local Current flows between nodes of Ranvier
- **Nodes of Ranvier**: Has many voltage gated Na+ channels which allow for faster movement because the action potential can jump

# Factors that Affect Propagation Speed
## Factors that Affect Propagation Speed
- **Axon Diameter**: More surface area which means more channels can be present in the membrane which means a faster local current
- **Amount of Myelination**: Heavy myelination is faster due to saltatory conduction
- **Temperature**: Proteins are affect by temperature and will speed up when hot
## Nerve Fiber Types
- Super fast conduction is not always required which is why there are different types of neuron fibers
 - **Type A**: 
	 - Large Diameter
	 - Myelination
	 - Conducts at 15-120 m/s 
	 - Motor Neurons, Supplying Skeletal and most sensory neurons
- **Type B**: 
	- Medium Diameter
	- Lightly Myelinated
	- Conducts at 3-15 m/s
	- Part of ANS
- **Type C**: 
	- Small Diameter
	- Unmyelinated
	- Conduct at 2 m/s
	- Part of ANS
# Electrical & Chemical Synapses
## Synapse
- **Synapse**: The junction between nerve cells which allow them to communicate
- **Presynaptic Cell**: The end of the axon
- **Postsynaptic Cell**: The receiving cell which would be a nerve or another tissue
## Electrical Synapse
- The two cell membranes are connected through connexons proteins and when an action potential spreads in one, it triggers the action potential in the other
- This is very important for coordinated contractions such as smooth and cardiac muscle

## Chemical Synapse
- There is no direction transfer of action potential
- Relies on neurotransmitter which are produced, stored, and released in synaptic vesicles made by the presynaptic terminals
![[Pasted image 20251018175259.png]]
- 1. Action potentials cause voltage gated calcium channels to open
- 2. Calcium will diffuse into the cell and stimulate exocytosis of the neurotransmitter
- 3. Neurotransmitter molecules diffuse across the synaptic cleft
- 4. The Transmitters will bind to the ligand gated Na+ channels
- 5. Na+ diffuses into cell and cause depolarization
