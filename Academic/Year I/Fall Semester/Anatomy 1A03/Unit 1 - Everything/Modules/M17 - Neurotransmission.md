# M17 - Neurotransmission
# Continuous & Saltatory Connection
## Propagation of Action Potentials
- **Nerve Impulse**: the self propagation of an action potential across a nerve membrane. This is triggered by depolarization which opens voltage gated ion channels across the membrane

## Types of Propagation - Unmyelinated Axons
### Unmyelinated Axon
- **Continuous Conduction**: action potentials occur at one spot in the membrane, but can propagate by **stimulating adjacent regions**. Action potentials also **spread in one direction only**
- **Local Current**: Refers to the movement of positive ions. 
- The absolute refractory period is stopping the action potential from propagating backwards

## Types of Propagation - Myelinated Axons
### Myelinated Axon
- **Saltatory Conduction**: Action potential conducted from one node of Ranvier to another
- Local Current flows between nodes of Ranvier
- **Nodes of Ranvier**: Has many voltage gated Na+ channels which allow for faster movement because the action potential can jump

# Factors that Affect Propagation Speed
## Factors that Affect Propagation Speed
- **Axon Diameter**: More surface area which means more channels can be present in the membrane which means a faster local current
- **Amount of Myelination**: Heavy myelination is faster due to saltatory conduction
- **Temperature**: Proteins are affect by temperature and will speed up when hot
## Nerve Fiber Types
- Super fast conduction is not always required which is why there are different types of neuron fibers
 - **Type A**: 
	 - Large Diameter
	 - Myelination
	 - Conducts at 15-120 m/s 
	 - Motor Neurons, Supplying Skeletal and most sensory neurons
- **Type B**: 
	- Medium Diameter
	- Lightly Myelinated
	- Conducts at 3-15 m/s
	- Part of ANS
- **Type C**: 
	- Small Diameter
	- Unmyelinated
	- Conduct at 2 m/s
	- Part of ANS
# Electrical & Chemical Synapses
## Synapse
- **Synapse**: The junction between nerve cells which allow them to communicate
- **Presynaptic Cell**: The end of the axon
- **Postsynaptic Cell**: The receiving cell which would be a nerve or another tissue
## Electrical Synapse
- The two cell membranes are connected through connexons proteins and when an action potential spreads in one, it triggers the action potential in the other
- This is very important for coordinated contractions such as smooth and cardiac muscle

## Chemical Synapse
- There is no direction transfer of action potential
- Relies on neurotransmitter which are produced, stored, and released in synaptic vesicles made by the presynaptic terminals
![[Pasted image 20251018175259.png]]
- 1. Action potentials cause voltage gated calcium channels to open
- 2. Calcium will diffuse into the cell and stimulate exocytosis of the neurotransmitter
- 3. Neurotransmitter molecules diffuse across the synaptic cleft
- 4. The Transmitters will bind to the ligand gated Na+ channels
- 5. Na+ diffuses into cell and cause depolarization
# Removal of NT & Postsynaptic Potentials
## Removal of Neurotransmitter
- **Diffusion**: Move down concentration Gradient away from the synaptic cleft
- **Enzyme Degradation**: Acetylcholinesterase will break down the Acetylcholine so it can no longer bind. This can still be combined back together in the synaptic terminal
- **Uptake of Neuron or Glial Cells**: Will transport the NT back into the synaptic terminal
- **Example**: Prozac acts as a serotonin uptake inhibitor which prevents the reuptake pump which leaves the serotonin in the synaptic cleft for longer which will trigger more allow serotonin to stimulate the postsynaptic membrane to reduce depressive symptoms

## Postsynaptic Potentials
- **Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential**: Depolarization of the membrane which will cause an action potential and cell response
- **Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential**: Hyperpolarization of the membrane which will move the cell away from threshold (could happen when opening a potassium or chloride channel). This could be useful for stopping unnecessary information from going to the brain
![[Pasted image 20251018181657.png]]
## Summation
- **Spatial Summation**: When different neurons trigger in different places on the cell body which will add together to create a action potential
- **Temporal Summation**: When the same neuron triggers multiple times to add up to create and action potential
![[Pasted image 20251018181949.png]]
## Summation of Postsynaptic Potentials
- Excitatory and Inhibitory Potentials will cancel each other out (in this example it will go through because there is a temporal summation that has not been cancelled)
