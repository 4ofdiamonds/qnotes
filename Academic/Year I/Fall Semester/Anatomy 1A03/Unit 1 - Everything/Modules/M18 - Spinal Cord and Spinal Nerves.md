# M18 - Spinal Cord and Spinal Nerves
## Spinal Cord and Spinal Nerves
- The anterior side of the spinal cord forms the vertebral canal which houses the spinal cord
- The labeling of each spinal nerve is dependent on where the spinal nerve exits from the vertebrae and not where it departs from the spinal cord because the vertebrae extend longer than the spinal cord

## Spinal Cord
- Acts as the communication link between the brain the PNS
- Integrates information and produces responses
- Extends from the **foramen magnum to L2**
- There are 31 spinal nerves in total
### Enlargements
- The spinal cord is not uniform in diameter and has two enlargements at the:
	- **Cervical Enlargement**: C4-T1
	- **Lumbosacral Enlargement**: T9-T12
- These enlargements occur due to higher nerve concentration from the upper and lower limbs
### Tapers
- **Conus Medullaris**: The end of the spinal cord ends but the nerves continue extending down the vertebral column and exit through the interverbal foramina or sacral foramina
- **Cauda Equina**: The hair like structure of the nerves at the end resemble of horses tail
- **Filum Terminale**: Extension of the pia matter around the spinal cord and anchors it to the inferior part of the vertebral column (coccyx)

## Meninges
- The meninges wraps continuously around the brain and spinal cord with the same layers despite some differences

### Dura Matter: 
- There is a space between the periosteum (bone) and the dura mater known as the epidural space which is filled with fat, blood vessels and connective tissue. Helps to hold and protect the spinal cord.
- Example: Women will get anesthesia injected into the epidural space to block the pain
### Arachnoid Mater: 
- Mostly the same
### Pia Mater:
- **Denticulate Ligaments**: Has projections that connect to the dura mater which allows for nerves to exit. This also stabilizes the position of the spinal cord
# Internal Anatomy of the Spinal Cord
## Internal Anatomy of the Spinal Cord
### White Matter:
- Two halves; three columns in each half
	- Each column subdivided into nerve tracts (fascicles)
	- Ascending and descending tracts – myelinated axons (white matter)
### Gray Matter
- Composed of posterior, anterior and lateral horns
	- Lateral horns – Autonomic nervous system
	- Posterior horns – Sensory neurons
	- Anterior horns (motor horn) – Motor neurons
- Gray and white commissures – axons that cross from one side of the spinal cord to the other
- Central canal – center of the gray commissure

## Sensory and Motor Processing
- Since the spinal cord is continuous moving up and down, damage to on area will affect everything else below it
### Examples
- **Polio**: Attacks cell body of motor neurons in the anterior horn and cranial cell bodies. Results in paralysis
- **ALS**: Similar concept as polio but is a result due to degeneration
![[Pasted image 20251018193620.png]]
- The internal anatomy of the spinal cord allows sensory and motor information to be processed in an organized way
- sensory neurons pass into the posterior horn through dorsal root
- synapse with interneurons or enter white matter and ascend or descend the cord
- motor neurons – anterior horn exit the ventral root

# Spinal Nerves
## Spinal Nerves
 - Each C nerve is named after the vertebrae inferior to them until C8 where nerve exits below the C7 vertebrae and After this point each nerve is named after the vertebrae superior to them
 - There are 4 pairs of nerves that exit through the sacral foramina
 - Others exit through the intervertebral foramina
 - 8 Cervical, 12 Thoracic, 5 Lumbar, 5 Sacral, 1 coccygeal

## Structure of Peripheral Nerves
### Protection of Peripheral Nerves
- **Endoneurium**: Protects nerve from one another which are grouped together into fascicles
- **Perineurium**: Blood vessels and adipose tissue surrounding the fascicles
- **Epineurium**: Continuous with the pia mater extending from the spinal cord
![[Pasted image 20251018212329.png]]
## Spinal Nerves
- Spinal nerves made from **6-8 rootlets** on the dorsal and ventral side of the spinal cord
- They will pass through the sub-arachnoid space and pierce the arachnoid mater to the join the spinal nerve
- They contain both sensory and motor neurons and each dorsal root contains a ganglion]
## Branches of the Spinal Nerve
- After the dorsal and ventral nerve combined they split into two **rami**
![[Pasted image 20251018214025.png]]
### Dorsal Ramus
- innervate deep muscles of the trunk responsible for movements of the vertebral column
### Ventral Ramus
- Thoracic region (T2-T12): form intercostal nerves
- Remaining spinal nerve ventral rami (roots of the plexus): five plexuses (intermingling of nerves). 
- Ventral rami of C1-C4 = cervical plexus
- Ventral rami of C5-T1 = brachial plexus
- Ventral rami of L1-L4 = lumbar plexus
- Ventral rami of L4-S4 = sacral plexus
- Ventral rami of S5 and Co = coccygeal plexus
# Spinal Plexuses
## Cervical Plexus
- Roots: C1-C4
- Function: Innervates superficial neck structures, skin of neck, posterior portion of head
- **Phrenic Nerve**: from C3-C5 and is responsible for innervating the diaphragm
![[Pasted image 20251018214646.png]]
## Brachial Plexus
- Roots: C5-T1
- 3 trunks, 6 divisions, 3 cords, 5 branches:
- 5 nerves: Axillary, Radial, Musculocutaneous, Ulnar, Median
![[Pasted image 20251018215134.png]]
## Lumbar and Sacral Plexuses
### Lumbar plexus
- Roots: L1-L4
- 2 Nerves: Obturator & femoral
- Supplies part of the lower limbs
### Sacral plexus
- Roots: L4-S4
- 2 Nerves: Tibial & common fibular which are bound together to form the sciatic nerve
- Supplies large portions of the lower limb

## Coccygeal Plexus
- S5-Co
- Muscles of pelvic floor
- Sensory information from skin over coccyx
