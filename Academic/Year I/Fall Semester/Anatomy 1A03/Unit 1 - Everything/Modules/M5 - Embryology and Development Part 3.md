# Embryonic Folding and the Formation of Gut
## Embryonic Folding and Gut Formation (Day 20)
- At this stage the ectoderm begins folding around the edges
- **Longitudinal Fold**: The lateral edges of the embryonic disk will fold around the longitudinal line in the center of the embryo
- **Medium Plane Folds**: The head and tail region will start folding inwards around the stomach area. This is when the ends of the gut tube start to form
	- **Hindgut**: Gut ending on the Caudal End
	- **Foregut**: Gut ending on the Cephalic End
- As both these folds occur they start pinching off the endoderm layer from the yolk sack.
- **Allantois**: some of the yolk sack will end up in the connecting stalk. This will eventually ==become the urinary system==
- **Coelom**: While the folding is occurring a little pocket in the mesoderm is ==forming which will become the body cavities==

## Embryonic Folding and Gut Formation (Day 25)
- At this stage the folding is starting to pinch off the yolk sack
- **Midgut**: The ectoderm continues to fold around the gut and starts to create a more prominent midgut
- During the folding process the ==oropharyngeal comes in contact with the endoderm which will connect the mouth to the digestive tract==. The same thing occurs with the ==cloacal membrane==
- **Yolk Stalk**: As the the ectoderm continues to pinch off the yolk sack and connect the ==ectoderm all the way around the endoderm and mesoderm== the narrow region of the yolk sack will be called this

## Embryonic Folding and Gut Formation (Day 30)
- At this stage the folding has completely pinched off the yolk sack and the ==ectoderm completely surrounds== the inside regions and the ==endoderm has now formed a tube==
- **Evaginations**: Little pouches or pockets that form along the gut tube which will turn into different organ systems throughout the body
- The gut tube and the somite/backbone formation occur at different rates which leaves the embryo to be curled in
- **Branchial Arches**: Pockets that get created in the ==ectoderm layer which will cause the evaginations of the gut tube to move in== and create certain systems such as the pharynx

## Conclusion
- Evaginations from gut tube form:
	- Anterior pituitary, thyroid gland, lungs, liver, pancreas
	- Branchial arches
		- Auditory tubes, tonsils, thymus and parathyroid glands
- Coelom
	- Fuses first around the heart as the pericardial cavity
	- Expands to become the pleural and peritoneal cavities
	- Cavities eventually become separate entities
# Limp Bud Development
## Limp Bud Development
- **Limp buds**/**Apical ectodermal ridge**: The ectoderm will start to thicken through a which will stimulate outward growth
- Limb Bud Development:
	- The upper appear at day 24 and lower limbs appear at day 28
	- The cells underneath the limb bud will start to multiply and grow
	- The limb is built from proximal to distal (arm-forearm-digits, thigh-leg-digits)
	- It takes 7 weeks to get to the digits, but apoptosis must take place in order to remove the webbing between fingers (week 8)
	- The protein that promotes the production of the limbs is called ==sonic the hedgehog protein==
	- The first thing that must be built first with the the blood supply, cartilage, muscles, nerves then the skeleton

## Thalidomide
-  Thalidomide inhibits the formation of blood vessels which will affect the first step in the creation of the limbs
## Skeleton, Muscles and Nerves
- Skeleton: develops from the mesoderm or neural crest cells, but starts as cartilage during development
- Muscle: **myoblasts** are derived from somite's and will travel to wherever the muscles need to be built and fuse to become multi-nucleated cells
- Nervous system: Just the nervous system
- The apical ectodermal ridge which will proliferate cells from the germ layers and will build the limbs in descending order
