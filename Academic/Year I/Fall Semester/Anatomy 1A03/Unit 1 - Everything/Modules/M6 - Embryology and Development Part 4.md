# Formation of the Blood Vessels and Heart

## Circulatory System (15-16)

- **Angioblasts**: Start as mesoderm cells but will differentiate and build the walls of blood vessels which is important due to the proximity to the yolk sack

- **Blood Islands**: Small pockets of angioblasts dispersed through the mesoderm

- **Endothelium**: The in the blood islands will start to create larger cavities and line the edges with angioblasts which become the Endothelial cells.

- In the differentiation occurs during day 15-16 in the yolk sack, but day 17 in the embryo

- Blood is also developed form the mesoderm and will create a pluripotent cell ==which can turn into white, or red blood cells, or platelets==, separate from the maternal supply

- **Endothelial tubes**: The Blood Islands will start to get ==larger and merge together to create larger tubes== and the blood will continue to proliferate inside the lumen of said tube.

## Heart Development

- **Endocardial Tubes**: Endoderm cells which are in the cariogenic region will be signaled to specialize

- **Primitive heart tube**: When two endocardial tubes fuse together and create a tube with 4 main dilations (stretched out regions)

    - **Sinus Venosus**: SA node and part of the right atrium

    - **Atrium**: Left atrium and part of the right

    - **Ventricle**: Most of the left ventricle

    - **Bulbus Cordis**: Most of the right ventricle

- After the fusion the tube ==will begin to bend which is important for the structure== of the heart

- The mesoderm will surround the heart with cardiac muscle which is **auto rhythmic** which means they can contract without the nervous system (3 weeks), but the contractions will do nothing

- **Arterial End**: Exit for the blood

- **Venous End**: Entrance for the blood

- Blood entering through the

    - **Sinus venosus**: (veins returning to the heart) into the

    - **Primitive atrium**: (left and right atria), then go into the

    - **Primitive ventricle**: (left and right ventricles), and into the

    - **Bulbus Cordis**: (aorta and pulmonary trunk)

- The folding of the heart is possible due to the constricted space combined with the growth of the heart (ventricle → forward and down) (atria → backwards and up)

- **SA node**: developed from the Bulbus Cordis and is the pacemaker of the heart

# Circulation Changes at Birth

## Heart Development (46-50)

- Recap: Body → Right atrium → Right Ventricle → Lungs → Left Atrium → Left Ventricle → Body

- **Septum Secundum**: Septum wall closest to the Right Atrium with a inferior hole

- **Septum Primum**: Septum wall closest to the Left Atrium with a superior hole

- **Foremen Ovale**: Since the lungs are collapsed in a fetus, the blood pressure allows the blood to skip the lungs and go directly out to the body

## Circulation Change at Birth

- In the fetus the lungs and liver are skipped because the maternal blood supply is oxygenated and filtered

- When the fetus is born the movement out of the placenta will cause the baby to self realize its ==deoxygenated state and will cause it to take its first breath==

- The change in pressure in the lungs will ==lower the pressure in the right atrium and increase pressure== in the left atrium, sealing off the Interatrial septum and cause the heart to beat normally

# Formation of the Lungs
## Respiratory System
- **Tracheal Bud**: The lung bud forms from a midline evagination of the gut tube in the foregut region
	- The gut tube behind the tracheal bud will turn into the pharynx and the other part of the gut tube will become esophagus
- **Bronchial Buds**: The lung bud will form form branches which will continue to form their own branches in a fractal like projection. This is the branching point between the right and left lung
![[Pasted image 20250919004247.png]]
- The branching will continue like this for **17 generations** until birth but the lungs continue developing up to **24 generations** in adults
	- Each generation is indicated by a **primary, secondary, tertiary**... etc
	- Primary: 5th week
	- Secondary: 6th week
	- Tertiary: 7th week
- The right lung will have 3 lobes (Superior, Middle, Inferior) and the left lung will have 2 lobes (Superior, Inferior). The left lung has less in order to make space for the heart
