# M7 - Epithelial Tissues
# Characteristics and Function of Epithelium
- **Histology**: The study of tissues through the staining and imaging techniques to observe the cellular and non-cellular components
- Tissues are classified through **3 main ways**
	- Structure of cells
	- Cell function
	- Extracellular matrix
- There are **4 primary tissue types**
	- Epithelial
	- Connective
	- Muscle
	- Nervous
## Epithelial vs Connective :Tissue
- **Epithelial**: Many cells tightly packed together and little extracellular matrix
- **Connective**: Scattered cells with lots of extracellular matrix. The Extracellular matrix determines the difference in tissue
	- Bone has hard extracellular matrix
	- Blood has fluid extracellular matrix

## Epithelial Characteristics
- Mostly provides protective coverings for the inside and outside of the body and also form glands
	- Outside skin
	- Line digestive, respiratory and urogenital system
	- Heart and blood vessels
	- Line body cavities
- The tissue also had different surfaces
	- **Apical**: Inside lumens, ducts or inside of cavities
	- **Basal**: Attached to the basement membrane which hold the cells into place
	- **Lateral**: Sides of the tissue which connect to other epithelial tissues
- **Basement Membrane**: Extracellular membrane which was secreted by epithelial cells above and connective tissue below and acts as a glue between the epithelial and connective tissue. 
- The membrane is also porous which allows for the diffusion of substances, which is important because the Epithelial cells are avascular
- Epithelial cells also have special cell to cell contact, and are also able to regenerate and replace damaged cells (most epithelial cells are at risk of being damaged)

## Functions of Epithelia
- Protecting underlying structures - e.g. lining in the mouth
- Acts as a barrier - e.g. skin
- Acts as a filter - e.g. kidneys to filter toxins
- Secretion of substances - e.g. pancreas
- Absorption of substances - e.g. small intestine
## Cell Surface Modification
- **Microvilli**: Finger like projections on the surface of the tissue which increase surface area, which increases absorption or secretion
- **Cilia**: Finger like projections but instead they allow for movement of objects on the surface of the tissue
