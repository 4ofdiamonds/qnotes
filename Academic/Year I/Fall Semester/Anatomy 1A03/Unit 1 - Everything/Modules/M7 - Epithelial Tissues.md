# M7 - Epithelial Tissues
# Characteristics and Function of Epithelium
- **Histology**: The study of tissues through the staining and imaging techniques to observe the cellular and non-cellular components
- Tissues are classified through **3 main ways**
	- Structure of cells
	- Cell function
	- Extracellular matrix
- There are **4 primary tissue types**
	- Epithelial
	- Connective
	- Muscle
	- Nervous
## Epithelial vs Connective :Tissue
- **Epithelial**: Many cells tightly packed together and little extracellular matrix
- **Connective**: Scattered cells with lots of extracellular matrix. The Extracellular matrix determines the difference in tissue
	- Bone has hard extracellular matrix
	- Blood has fluid extracellular matrix

## Epithelial Characteristics
- Mostly provides protective coverings for the inside and outside of the body and also form glands
	- Outside skin
	- Line digestive, respiratory and urogenital system
	- Heart and blood vessels
	- Line body cavities
- The tissue also had different surfaces
	- **Apical**: Inside lumens, ducts or inside of cavities
	- **Basal**: Attached to the basement membrane which hold the cells into place
	- **Lateral**: Sides of the tissue which connect to other epithelial tissues
- **Basement Membrane**: Extracellular membrane which was secreted by epithelial cells above and connective tissue below and acts as a glue between the epithelial and connective tissue. 
- The membrane is also porous which allows for the diffusion of substances, which is important because the Epithelial cells are avascular
- Epithelial cells also have special cell to cell contact, and are also able to regenerate and replace damaged cells (most epithelial cells are at risk of being damaged)

## Functions of Epithelia
- Protecting underlying structures - e.g. lining in the mouth
- Acts as a barrier - e.g. skin
- Acts as a filter - e.g. kidneys to filter toxins
- Secretion of substances - e.g. pancreas
- Absorption of substances - e.g. small intestine
## Cell Surface Modification
- **Microvilli**: Finger like projections on the surface of the tissue which increase surface area, which increases absorption or secretion
- **Cilia**: Finger like projections but instead they allow for movement of objects on the surface of the tissue
# Types of Epithelial Tissue
## Classification of Epithelium
### Number of layers of cells
- **Simple**: One layer of cells that all connect to the basement membrane
- **Stratified**: More than one layer, the cells above the first layer attached to the basement membrane will attach to the other cells in the tissue
- **Pseudostratified**: Tissue looks stratified, but all the cells attach to the basement membrane, because the cells are all different heights and only some cells reach the surface
### Shape of cells on apical surface
- **Squamous**: Flat, scale like
- **Cuboidal**: About equal in height and width
- **Columnar**: Taller than they are wide
![[Pasted image 20250919021152.png]]
## Functional Characteristics
- **Simple**: Allows for diffusion of gases, filtration of blood, secretion and absorption
- **Stratified**: protection, particularly against abrasion
- **Pseudostratified**: modification
- **Squamous**: Allow diffusion or act as filters
	- (Simple+Squamous=Least barrier for diffusion)
- **Cuboidal and Columnar**: Secretion or absorption. May include goblet cells that produce and secrete mucus
- **Goblet Cells**: Produce or secrete mucus
## Epithelium Types
- Columnar can be either ciliated or non-ciliated
- Stratified Squamous can be:
	- **Non-keratinized**: Outer layer is alive and has a fluid covering it
	- **Keratinized**: Has a layer of dead cells with the keratin protein around it
- **Transitional**: Stratified cuboidal to columnar which can stretch to appear to be squamous like

## Simple Squamous Epithelium
- **Structure**: Single layer of flat cells
- **Locations**: Lining of blood vessels, alveoli of the lungs, Bowmans capsule of kidney, lining of serous membrane
- **Functions**: Diffusion, Filtration, Secretion
![[Pasted image 20250919022408.png]]
### Bowmans Capsule
- Responsible for filtering urine which is good because this type of tissue is good for diffusion
![[Pasted image 20250919022533.png]]
## Simple Cuboidal Epithelium
- **Structure**: Single layer of cube-shaped cells
- **Locations:** Kidney tubules, glands and their ducts, and surface of the ovaries
- **Functions**: Secretion and absorption
![[Pasted image 20250919022752.png]]
### Kidney
- Tubules of the kidney
![[Pasted image 20250919022819.png]]
## Simple Columnar Epithelium
- **Structure**: single layer of tall, narrow cells. Some have cilia or microvilli
- **Location**: Glands, bronchioles, uterus, uterine tubes, stomach, intestines, gallbladder, ventricles of the brain
- **Functions**: Movement of particles out of the bronchioles, aids in movement of oocytes through the uterine tubes, secretion by glands of the stomach and the intestine, absorption by cells of the intestine
- **The brush border**: the microvilli looks like the brush
- **Absorptive cells**: cells that absorb
### Nonciliated

#### The Lining of the Stomach

## Ciliated
![[Pasted image 20250919023306.png]]
#### Uterine tube
![[Pasted image 20250919023534.png]]
## Pseudostratified Columnar Epithelium
- **Structure:** All cells reach basement membrane. Almost always ciliated and associated with goblet (mucus-producing) cells.
- **Locations**: Lining of most of the upper respiratory tract (ciliated); male urethra and epididymis (nonciliated).
- **Functions:** synthesize and secrete mucus, move mucus (or fluid) that contains foreign particles, absorption and protection

### Trachea

## Stratified Squamous Epithelium
- **Structure:** multiple layers of cells that are cuboidal in the basal layer and progressively flatten to toward the surface
- **Locations:** nonkeratinized - mouth, throat, esophagus, anus, vagina, keratinized - skin
- **Functions:** Protection against abrasion, ultraviolet radiation, water loss, and infection

### Mouth (Nonkeratinized)

### Skin (Keratinized)

## Transitional Epithelium
- **Structure:** Stratified - cells change shape depending upon amount of distention of the organ
- **Location**: lining of the urinary system
- **Functions**: Accommodates fluctuations in the volume of fluid in an organ or tube; protection against the caustic effects of urine 
### Urinary Bladder

# Glands
## Glands
- Glands are either a single cell or mass of epithelial cells that have been adapted for mass secretion
- There are two types of glands formed by epithelium:
	- **Endocrine**: No open contact with exterior, no ducts, and produces hormones and releases them into the blood
	- **Exocrine**: Open contact maintained with exterior, ducts (sweat glands, milk glands, secretions of digestive fluid)
## Endocrine Glands
- There is a follicle within the gland that release the hormones
![[Pasted image 20250919025133.png]]
## Exocrine Glands
- A bunch of epithelial cells which produce fluids which will exit the body through a duct
