# M8 - Connective Tissues
# Cells and Functions of Connective Tissues
## Connective Tissue
- Connective Tissue is found in every organ and is the most abundant tissue in the body
- Characterized by **very few cells**, separated by **lots of extracellular matrix**
- The primary role of the cells in connective tissues is **to maintain the extracellular matrix**
- Connective tissue has lots of different and important functions
- Most extracellular tissues are vascular which means they have a direct blood supply
## Functions of Connective Tissue
- Connective tissue **acts as a barrier** to enclose organs and separate them from other tissues in the body. They also separate tissues that need to be separated
- They also **connect** tissues together (ligaments, tendons)
- Allow for different types of **movement and support** of muscle (Bones)
- They also act as **storage** for different minerals and macromolecules in the body (Fat)
- Cushion for protection and insulation the body (Fat)
- **Transportation** of blood
- **Protection** (immune system, fat and bones)
## Cells of Connective Tissue
- Naming of Connective tissues
	- **Blasts**: create the matrix, (example osteoblast - creates bone matrix). Are the "immature" version of the cell
	- **Cytes**: maintain the matrix, (example chondrocyte - maintains cartilage). Are the "mature" version of the cell
	- **Clasts**: break down matrix for remodeling, (example - osteoclasts)
	- **Macrophages**: get rid of debris within connective tissue which come from monocytes which are a type of white blood cell
	- **Mast**: release heparin which allow for allergic reactions
# Extracellular Matrix
## Extracellular Matrix
- 1) Protein fibers
	- **Collagen**: created by **collagen protein fibril** which turns into **inelastic fibers**
	- **Reticular**: is made of collagenous protein but **branch out and fill space** and provide s**upporting framework for soft organs**
	- **Elastic**: made from the the **elastic protein** and are strong and stretchy. They are also **crosslinked which means there are connections between the fibers** (They make up the lungs and blood vessels)
- 2) Ground substance (filler)
	- **Hyaluronic acid**: a polysaccharide which acts as a lubricant in joints and lubricant in the eye
	- **Proteoglycan**: long protein core with many polysaccharides attached which holds lots of water. 
	- **Glycosaminoglycan**: is the most common polysaccharide used to create proteoglycans. To create the proteoglycan aggregate, hyaluronic acid is used to hold it together. 
	- **Adhesion proteins**: Hold proteoglycans and other things together and attach them to neighboring cells
- The matrix created depend on the proportions of these structures will create certain characteristics in the tissues
# Loose Connective Tissues
## Mature Connective Tissues
- Can be separated into 3 major categories
	- **Connective Tissue Proper**: general connective tissue which can be categorized into
		- **Loose**: Fewer fibers and more ground substance. There are three types of this tissue
			- **Areolar**: Mostly collagen and mostly filles in the space between cells and tissues
			- **Adipose**: Storage of fat and fuel
			- **Reticular**: Made of reticular fibers and are used in the lymphatic system
		- **Dense**: More fiber and less ground substance. There are two categories of this tissue
			- **Regular/Irregular**: All line up in the same or different directions
			- **Collagenous**: Mainly collagen fibers
			- **Elastic**: Mainly elastic fibers
	- **Supporting Connective Tissue**: Mostly cartilage or bone
	- **Fluid connective Tissue**: Mostly Blood
## Loose Areolar CT
- **Structure**
	- The loose packing material of most organs and tissues
	- Has all types of protein fibers but mostly collogen
	- This type of CT will have lots of different types of cells mentioned previously (macrophages, white blood cells, and fibroblast cells)
- **Function**
	- Attaches to underlying tissues to the skin and fills in the gaps

## Adipose Tissue
- **Structure**
	- Densely packed adipose cells which are filled to the brim with triglycerides
	- Often found near Areolar CT
- **Function**
	- Energy storage, supports and protects organs, and insulation

# Dense Connective Tissues
## Dense Regular Collagenous CT
- **Structure**
	- Since the collagen fibers line up they maximize the strength of the direction of the fibers
- **Function**
	- Used in tendons (muscles to bones) and ligaments (bones to bones)

## Dense Irregular Collagenous CT
- **Structure**
	- Randomly oriented fibers gives strength in multiple directions
- **Function**
	- Forms most of the skin, scars and capsules of kidney and spleen which requires strength in multiple directions

## Dense Regular Elastic Connective Tissue
- **Structure**
	- The collagen fibers give it strength but the elastin makes it usable 
- **Function**
	- Mostly found in the vocal folds, or the nuchal ligament which attaches to the back of your skull to help keep your head upright
![[Pasted image 20250924032625.png]]
## Dense Irregular Elastic Connective Tissue
- **Structure**
	- Bundles and sheets of collagenous and elastic fibers oriented in multiple directions
- **Function**
	- Mostly found in elastic arteries which are the arteries that leave the heart. This must stretch in multiple directions and not just one
