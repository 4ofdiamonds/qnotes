## Functions of the Nervous System
- Sensory
	- Sense changes in the external environment
	- Additionally sense changes of changes of our internal environment
- Motor
	- Respond to the stimuli and trigger muscles
	- Also triggers glands and hormone release
- Integrative
	- Analyze information that comes in, stores and processes the information, and makes decisions 
## Nervous System
- Components: Brain, Spinal Cord, Nerves, Sensory Receptors
- Subdivisions: CNS (Brain and Spinal Cord), PNS (Nerves and Sensory Receptors)
## Main Divisions of the Nervous System
- Nerves are grouped depending on where they originate or terminate
	- **Cranial Nerves**: Enter or exit the brain
	- **Spinal Nerves**: Enter or exit the spine

# Components of the Peripheral Nervous System
## Components of the Peripheral Nervous System
- **Sensory Receptors**: Endings of neurons or specialize endings that detect the external environment
- **Nerve**: A bundle of axons and sheathes from nerve cells and connect to the CNS to sensory receptors, and muscles and glands
- All nerves are bilateral
	- **Cranial Nerves**: Has 12 pairs
	- **Spinal Nerves**: Has 31 pairs
- **Ganglion**: Collection of neuron cell bodies outside the CNS. Most of the time the Cell body is in the CNS and only the axon leaves to go to the rest of the body. 
	- All sensory information which does not go to the brain (from spinal nerves) have their neuron cell bodies in a ganglion
	- In motor system there is a two neuron system where the neuron which leaves the spinal chord will connect with the next neuron in the system and where they connect is a ganglion
- **Plexus**: A network of axons which allows for the exchange of neural information outside the CNS
## Division of the PNS
- **Sensory (Afferent)**: transmit action potential from receptors to CNS triggered by the external environment
- **Motor (Efferent)**: take action potential from the CNS to the effector tissues which are muscles (skeletal, cardiac, or smooth) or glands
- **Sematic Nervous System**: Involved in targeting skeletal muscle 
- **Autonomic Nervous System**: Involved in targeting cardiac,  smooth muscle and glands. This system is split into the Parasympathetic and Sympathetic Divisions

# PNS Motor Divisions
## Sensory Divisions of PNS
- **General Senses**: Receptors throughout the body
- **Special Sense**: Receptors in specialized organs

## Motor Divisions of PNS
### Somatic Nervous System
- **Somatic Nervous System**: Skeletal Muscles are all voluntarily controlled by a single neuron system. This means all the cell body are in the spinal chord and a single axon will travel to the specified target muscle
- **Synapse**: A connection with a neuron-neuron or neuron-muscle. Acts as a place to control action potential. The neuromuscular junction is the intersection between the nerve and the skeletal cell
![[Pasted image 20250924040756.png]]
- Motor information goes out on the frontal side
- Sensory information comes in on the dorsal side
- All spinal nerves are able to carry both sensory and motor
### Autonomic Nervous System
- **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)**: From CNS to smooth muscle, cardiac muscle and certain glands and is associated with involuntary control.
	- **Two Neuron System**: The first nerve foes from the CNS to the ganglion and then the ganglion to effector
- **Sympathetic Nervous System**: Prepare the body to do physical activity (fight-or-flight). Can be any time you move from resting condition to active
- **Parasympathetic Nervous System**: Regulates vegetative function such as digestion of food (rest-and-digest)

### Enteric Nervous System
- **Enteric Nervous System (ENS)**: A series of plexuses which control the digestive tract independent from the CNS. Communication is still possible through the ANS
- **Sensory**: This system has sensory nerves which detect chemical environment or stretching of the walls
- **Motor**: In response to the sensory signals contraction of smooth muscle or secretion of the GI organs and endocrine cells
