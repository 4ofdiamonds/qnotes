## Creating a hypothesis
- What is a hypothesis? - Educated guess to answer a research question
- Formulating a hypothesis (first statement - second statement)
	- If - Then
	- Based on - We expect
	- Assuming that - It is probable that
Assuming that my ancestral diet contained high levels of starch consumption, It is probable that my AMY1A gene copy number would be similar to that of high starch consumers and my AMY1A production would be higher than the mean.
