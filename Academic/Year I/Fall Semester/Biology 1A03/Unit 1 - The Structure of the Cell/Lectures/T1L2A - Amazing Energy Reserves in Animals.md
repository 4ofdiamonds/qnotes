# Animals
## Camels
- Energy
	- Animals only carry enough glycogen to last 15 minutes worth of exercise
	- Camels have evolved to store the fat tristearin which has a lot of potential energy
	- When fat is metabolized it also produced water which can be used as hydration
- Water Conservation
	- Camels can also loose up to 30-40% of their body weight, significantly more than humans
	- They also minimize water loss by condensing water in their nostrils (warm air hits cold nose)
	- Their feces is also incredibly dry
## Geese
- Energy
	- Geese can fly for hours upon end
	- They do this by eating for 12 hours a day and before flight sometimes even longer
	- During flight the geese can loose up to half their body weight during migration
	- All of this comes from fat
## Bar Headed Geese
-  Energy
	- Bar Headed Geese can fly at thousands of meters in the sky while flying in low oxygen conditions
# Fats
## Lipolysis
- **Beta Oxidation of Fat**: 
	- Adipocyte are the cites at where the fats are stored
	- The fatty acids from the fat cells are transported into the blood stream to the tissues that are metabolically active
	- The myocyte, the muscle cite, is where Beta Oxidation of Fat takes place and the carbon chains are turned into acetyl coA
	- The acetyl coA is now able to enter into the kreb cycle
	- Each fat molecule yields significantly more ATP than glucose
## Hypoxic Environments
- Adaptations:
	- Larger lungs
	- Better breathing patterns
	- Red blood cells with higher affinity to oxygen
	- Higher Distribution of capillaries at lungs and muscles
	- Greater number of mitochondria at each muscle cell
## Alternative Fuel Sources
