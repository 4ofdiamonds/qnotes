## Nucleic Acids
- **COULD BE ON TEST**: Why do you find virulent bacteria in the blood? 
- The bacteria is virulent because it has the genes which can create the film to protect itself and replicate
- Fred Griffith did not discover that DNA was the genetic material
- It was Oswald Avery, Maclyn McCarty, and Colin McLeod which create the experiment which determined the genetic source of information
## Experiment
- They took the s-strain extract and combined it together with the r-strain and replicated the original experiment as a control
- They then eliminated one macromolecule at a time to determine what the hereditary material was
- **COULD BE ON TEST**: if the mouse dies you know that the whatever was destroyed was not the hereditary material
- **BE COMFERTABLE WITH EXPLAINING THIS EXPERIEMENT**
## Nucleotides
