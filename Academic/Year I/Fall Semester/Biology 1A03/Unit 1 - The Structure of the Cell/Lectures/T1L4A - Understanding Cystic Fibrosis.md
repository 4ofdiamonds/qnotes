## What is cystic fibrosis
- Due to the thick mucus, bacteria is able to infect the inside
	- Persistent cough
	- Thick mucus
	- Wheezing, shortness of breath
	- Chest infection and/or pneumonia
	- Bowel disturbances
	- Salty tasting sweat

## Endoscopy of a normal unaffected airway
- By using an endoscope which is a camera attached to the fiber optic cable which will travel down the trachea and into the lungs
- an unhealthy endoscope will have increased, green, mucus levels and inflamed capillaries

## Mucus clearance is essential for respiratory health
- Goblet cells will secrete mucus onto the surface of the tissue which is used to trap particles and bacteria
- The cilia on the surface of the tissue will move the mucus out of the trachea to get rid of the foreign bodies
- The height of the mucus is very important so that it is lined up with the height of the cilia

- **Muco-Ciliary Movement**: the movement of the cilia in the airway surface liquid move rhythmically to create an undercurrent which moves the mucus along
## A cystic fibrosis milestone
- In 1989 in toronto, the CFTR gene found in chromosome 7 was discovered to be the gene mutated which normally codes for the membrane protein for chloride ions across the membrane

- The protein impacts the chloride ion concentration and the sodium ions which will change the concentration of water and therefore the direction of water movement

- If the CFTR protein is dysfunctional, none of the chloride ions can leave which means the regulation of the sodium channels is gone and sodium ions will flood into the cell.
- The water will flood into the cell and the airway surface liquid disappears and the mucus will be directly on top of the cilia which prevents it from moving

## Mutations of the CFTR gene
- There are over 1900 disease associated cystic fibrosis causing mutations
- The deletion of one amino acid (phenylalanine) at amino acid residue 508 is the most common mutation that accounts for over 2/3 of cystic fibrosis
- This causes the protein to not reach the surface at all, or prevents it from working all together

## Understanding cystic fibrosis
- N is where the nucleus is
- The researchers in the study took a fluorescent tag and tagged the protein channels
- $\Delta F 508$ indicates a change in the f(phe) amino acid at position 508. If it was changed to another protein
- With the deletion there is no way to make the protein fold properly

## Outcomes of mutations in the CFTR gene
- Outcome 1: The protein is too damaged to be transported
- Outcome 2: The protein is transported into the membrane but works abnormally

# Possible Therapeutics
## Pharmacological intervention - pharmacochaperones
- Chaperone proteins will help shape proteins and fold them, but a mutation will prevent it from doing its job properly
- Biochemists will create molecules that is attracted to the protein and will wedge the transport protein open
- The corrector molecules can help with the protein folding by entering into the ER and change help with the protein folding so they can be released into the membrane
- They can also target the protein channels in less severe cases

## Rescuing CFTR function with pharmacochaperones
- The researchers will start in a dish and inject CFpot-532 into the cells with dysfunctional chloride ions and will measure the electrical reading for change in ions

## Ivacaftor and Lumacaftor
- In Canada these are the two drugs which help with cystic fibrosis
- The cost in the united states is $300,000/year/patient to sell this drug
