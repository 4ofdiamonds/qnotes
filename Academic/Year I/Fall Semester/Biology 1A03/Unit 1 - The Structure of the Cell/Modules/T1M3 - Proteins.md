# T1M3 - Proteins
---
# Unit 1 | Proteins: What do they do? How are they made? What do they look like?
## Proteins have various structures
- **Transport**
- **Movement**
- **Enzymes**
- **Defense**
- The function of the protein is determined by its form and structure
## How are proteins represented?
- **Space filling diagrams**: Proteins have accurately sized molecules. This diagram is used to represent the true shape of the protein
- **Ribbon Diagram**: Proteins are represented by their amino acid structures to emphasize the different folds
# An overview of protein synthesis: from DNA to primary protein structures
## Genetic information codes for proteins
- [[4.2 Transcription]]
 ![[Pasted image 20250915221010.png]]
## The code for a protein is in the nucleus
- The DNA is stored in the double membraned nucleus which transcripts mRNA to be sent out to be translated in the cytoplasm
## Nuclear pores connect the nucleus with the cytosol
- There are nuclear pores along the membrane of the nucleus which allow for the transportation of materials
- Ribosomes are created and bind with proteins within the nucleus and are transported out through the pores
![[Pasted image 20250915230541.png]]
## Transcribed RNA exits the nucleus
- The nuclear pores also transport all necessary materials for DNA replication inside the cell
## Ribosomes synthesize proteins
- Ribosomes can either remain free and dissolve in the cytosol or become membrane bound on the endoplasmic reticulum
- The different ribosomes will create different types of proteins
## All proteins are linear polymers of amino acids
- [[1.4 Proteins]]
- Amino acids are attached through condensation reactions of amino acids
![[Pasted image 20250915231055.png]]
## Translation occurs inside the ribosome
- The tRNA will attach their anti codons to the mRNA which will attach the specified amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain.
![[Pasted image 20250915231202.png]]
## Variable chains have distinct properties
- **Residue**: The functional groups off the sides of amino acids
- Different functional groups will act differently and contribute to the folding of the 3D protein shape
	- **Hydrophobic**: Hydrophobic side chains may aggregate when dissolved in water. This is because of thermodynamically stable hydrophobic interactions
	- **Hydrophilic**: Hydrophilic will be charged polarized and will be capable of forming ionic bonds while other side chains may create hydrogen bonds
![[Pasted image 20250915232927.png]]
## Free ribosomes translate proteins in the cytosol
- The location of the ribosomes depends on where the protein will end up 
- Translation occurring in the cytosol will send the proteins to one of these places
	- Cytoplasm
		- Enzymes in glycolysis
		- Integral proteins of the cell
			- Actin
			- Tubulin
	- Nucleus
		- Histone Protein
		- Transcription factors
	- Mitochondria
		- Membrane bound proteins
- Proteins designed for an organelle will have a sequence on itself that will target another protein to bring it to the organelle
# Protein Folding
## Properties of macromolecules determine structure
- Just like the cell membranes, the protein sequences with hydrophobic ends will clump together whether they are folded on free floating ribosomes or bound ribosomes
![[Pasted image 20250915233113.png]]
## The linear polymer is folded into a 3-D protein
![[Pasted image 20250915233340.png]]
## Secondary Structure: Alpha Helix
- Each carbonyl group will form a hydrogen bond with a amino acid amino group 4 positions away and cause it to spiral
- The residue will be expose to the outside and will create a function of the protein
![[Pasted image 20250915233427.png]]
## Secondary Structure: Beta Sheets
- Made up of parallel amino acid with hydrogen bonds in between
![[Pasted image 20250915233608.png]]
## Variable side chains help to fold proteins
- Different types of forces to help fold proteins
	- Hydrogen bonds
	- Van der Waals forces
	- Covalent
	- Ionic
	- Disulfide Bridges
	- Hydrophobic/Hydrophilic Interactions
![[Pasted image 20250915234221.png]]
# Assisting the process of protein folding
- **Molecular chaperones**: These proteins will attach to the recently formed polypeptides and ==hold them in place to prevent incorrect folding==
- **Chaperonins**: Large molecular complexes which will isolate polypeptide chains to be folded correctly
![[Pasted image 20250915234207.png]]
## Hemoglobin as an example of protein folding

# Unit 4 | Leaving the endomembrane system and reaching a target
## Functions of the endomembrane system
- **Endomembrane System**: Membranes within the cell that allow for the compartmentalization of different environments to perform different functions required inside the cell
- This system is required to create certain environments for protein folding
## Bound ribosomes synthesize proteins in the ER
- mRNA that code for proteins that are bound for the endomembrane system code for a sequence on the end of the protein which will bind the ribosome to the surface of the ER. 
- This sequence occurs at the initial formation of the protein.
- The sequence will ==bind a signal recognition particle, SRP, to the signal recognition particle receptor== on the surface of the membrane.
- The protein will continue to be translated and will enter into the lumen or central canal of the ER. 
- Once inside the sequence will be cleaved off and will now be able to be processed into a mature protein
![[Pasted image 20250915235306.png]]
## The endomembrane system further processes proteins
- Most proteins will get trapped in vesicles that bud off from the ER. Some proteins will instead stay in the ER
- **Glycosylation**: The attachment of carbohydrate signals to most secreted and membrane bound proteins. This will help the ==protein stability, folding and cell-cell recognition==. This can occur in the ER or the Golgi apparatus
![[Pasted image 20250916000105.png]]
# The Golgi apparatus modifies and ships ER products
- The proteins will be modified, often with more Glycosylation and will be ready to be shipped out again but some proteins again will stay inside. 
- Proteins will travel to the other organelles, or to the membrane to become porins, receptors or secreted out of the cell as ==antibodies, enzymes, or hormones.==
![[Pasted image 20250916000054.png]]
## Proteins are tagged as they leave the Golgi
- Proteins are tagged and sorted into different vesicles which themselves have tags to transport to other organelles. 
![[Pasted image 20250916000355.png]]
## Protein structures - how did they get here?
- **Cytoskeleton**: A network of fibers and proteins which aids in cell shape and transportation
- **Microtubules**: These structures are protein polymers which have long fibers which stretch though the cell. These long fibers act as roadways that move vesicles around the cell
- Motor Proteins such as kinesin or dionine are able to ==attach to transport vesicles and walk along the microtubules== using the energy from ATP

## Free ribosome destination sites
![[Pasted image 20250916001200.png]]
# Unit 5 | Protein structure and function: transmembrane pores
## Aquaporins are embedded in the cell membrane
- Aquaporins are found in all types of cells.
![[Pasted image 20250916001746.png]]
## Structure of aquaporin
- The aquaporin is made of 4 protein subunits. Each protein monomer has ==inwards facing alpha helices== which create the hydrophilic interior (hydrogen bonds) and in total creates 4 pores per aquaporin. The aquaporin itself does not change shape but instead uses water to hydrogen bond with the side chains to push the other water molecules forward

## Bacterial Porin
![[Pasted image 20250916002809.png]]
## What happens if a protein misfolds
- Cystic Fibrosis occurs when a protein misfolds and can create massive changes in lungs and breathing
