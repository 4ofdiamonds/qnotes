# T1M4 - Nucleic Acids

# Unit 1 | Nucleic Acids
## Where is found in the cell
- [[4.4 Prokaryotic Gene Control]] Prokaryotes have free floating ring shaped DNA and smaller plasmid rings of DNA. This allows for the rapid spread of genes as Prokaryotes can share the plasmids
- [[4.5 Eukaryotic Gene Control]] Eukaryotes have packed chromosomes inside the nucleus
## What does Prokaryotic Chromosome look like?
- The E coli Chromosome is coiled into 100 loops and associate with proteins to form the nucleoid. This allows for compact storage of DNA

## Scientists create "maps" of bacterial chromosomes
- 2000 bacterial strains have been sequenced by scientists and map different genes onto the circle of the bacteria chromosome

# DNA as hereditary material
- Streptococcus pneumoniae is normally benign and not harmful but virulent strains are associated with being mildly harmful
## The Streptococcus bacteria may be virulent or benign
- The researcher Griffith injected different types of the bacteria into mice to see the effects. 
	- R strain = Rough Membrane, Harmless
	- S strain = Smooth Membrane, Virulent
		- The s strain will release a polysaccharide coat which prevents it from being detected by the body

- The benign bacteria was able to take the virulent DNA and use it to become harmful
## Transformation
- **Transformation**: A change in cell behavior resulting from the incorporation of genetic material from outside of the cell. 
## Which macromolecule carries hereditary information?

- The researchers concluded that by using enzymes to destroy DNA, the bacteria could no longer inherit the genes from the dead bacteria
# Unit 3 | Structure of DNA
## Looking at DNA molecules
- X-ray crystallography was used to determine the double helix shape of DNA
- [[1.5 Nucleic Acids]]
- [[4.1 DNA replication]]
## Nucleotides are the subunits of DNA
![[Pasted image 20250916010128.png]]
## There are four chemically distinct nucleotides in DNA
- **Pyrimidines**: Aromatic heterocyclic 
	- Cytosine
	- Thymine
-  **Purines**: Pyrimidine ring + Amidazole Ring
	- Guanine
	- Adenine
![[Pasted image 20250916010424.png]]
## Nucleotides polymerize using phosphodiester bonds
![[Pasted image 20250916010414.png]]
## Purines pair with pyrimidines
- **Chargaff's rule**: Purines and Pyrimidines should have a 1-1 ratio because they pair together. 
- Since they pair at equal distance the distance between the backbones should be consistent
![[Pasted image 20250916010725.png]]
## This is the structure of a double helix
![[Pasted image 20250916010752.png]]
# Unit 4 | Structure of RNA
## DNA holds the blueprint for RNA synthesis
- RNA is based on the DNA sequence and is created by RNA polymerase
- [[4.2 Transcription]]
![[Pasted image 20250916010917.png]]
## There are differences between DNA and RNA
- The ==2' position has one less oxygen in Deoxyribose==
	- Ribose in RNA
	- Deoxyribose in DNA
![[Pasted image 20250916011051.png]]
## An alternate nucleotide is used in RNA
- Uracil is used instead of Thymine
- ![[Pasted image 20250916011152.png]]
## Phosphodiester bonds connect ribonucleotides
![[Pasted image 20250916011320.png]]
## mRNAs carry information to make proteins
- **messenger RNA**: mRNA is the copy or RNA which will ==code for the protein== and is translated by ribosomes
## tRNA match mRNA with amino acids
- **transfer RNA**: tRNA will ==carry the amino acids== to match up with the codons on the mRNA sequences. It is still made of nucleotides but is folded in such a way it will never be translated
## rRNA are part of the ribosome complex
- **ribosomal RNA**: are part of the folded protein structure of the ribosomes
# Unit 5 | DNA in Eukaryotes
## Structure and Function of Eukaryotic DNA
![[Pasted image 20250916012004.png]]
## The same basic units make up all genomes
- The size of the Eukaryotic genome and chromosomes is significantly larger than the Prokaryotic genome.
