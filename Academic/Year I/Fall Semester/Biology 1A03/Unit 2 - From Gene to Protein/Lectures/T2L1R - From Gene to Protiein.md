# Module 1 | Transcription
## From Gene to Protein
- What are the structures
- What are the function
- What is the significance
## Comparing Gene Expression
- **COULD BE ON TEST**: BE ABLE TO DISTNIGUISH WHATS ON TEST

## DNA transcription from a template strand
- **COULD BE ON TEST**: Know the strand used is determined by the orientation of the promoter region 
- **COULD BE ON TEST**: Know template, nontemplate, coding, noncoding, missense, antisense, +, - strand
## Prokaryotic RNA Polymerase
- RNA polymerase is the core enzyme and combines with the Sigma protein to create a holoenzyme
![[Pasted image 20250923124123.png]]
## Sigma and Promoters
- Sigma proteins guide RNA polymerase to the promoters
- Promoters are sites on the DNA template where transcription begins
![[Pasted image 20250923124351.png]]
- **CONSENUS SEQUENCE (MUST KNOW)**: 
## Transcription Initiation - Prokaryotes
- How many sigma proteins do bacteria have?
	- Bacteria have several types of sigma proteins, each binds to different promoters, determining which genes are transcribed during a given time
- What happens when sigma binds to the promoter?
	- DNA double helix will open and the strands are threaded through the DNA channels
## Elongation of Transcription - Prokaryotes
- RNA polymerase moves 3' to 5' along the template DNA strand
- It adds nucleotides to the 3' end of the RNA molecule
## Transcription

## Termination of Transcription - Prokaryotes
- Specific sequences on the DNA act as termination sites
- The sequences can result in hairpin structures which cause the RNA strand to separate from the RNA polymerase, which stops the transcription
- Specific Termination proteins may facilitate the release of some bacteria
## Transcription - Prokaryotes

## Transcription and Translation in Prokaryotes
- Since there is no nuclear envelope the mRNA can be read right away and translated into proteins.
- This can happen in Prokaryotes due to their simplicity and lack of mRNA preparation after the fact

## Transcription in Eukaryotes
- Transcription factors are the most important part of starting the mRNA transcription
![[Pasted image 20250923125404.png]]
## 3 Types of RNA polymerase - Eukaryotes

![[Pasted image 20250923125514.png]]
- **COULD BE ON TEST**: Know the difference between Eukaryote and Prokaryote structures of the RNA polymerase complexes
## Introns and Exons - Eukaryotes
- Eukaryotic DNA is much longer in length compared to the mRNA due to the presence of Introns
## Processing mRNA and Splicing in Eukaryotes

## Post-Transcriptional Processing of Eukaryotic mRNAs
- 5' Cap
	- a 7-mehtylguanosine is attached to the mRNA through an unusual 5' to 5' triphosphate linkage
- 3' Poly A tail
	- Consists of 150-200 adenines is added to the 3' end of the mRNA 
	- Functions to protect the transcript from degradation''
## Post-Transcriptional Processing of Eukaryotic mRNAs
- Intron Splicing is catalyzed by a complex of proteins and snRNPs 
- **COULD BE ON TEST**: DETAILED SUMMARY OF THE PROCESS OF SPLICING IN THE LECUTRE RESOURCE FOLDER ON AVENUE
# Module 2 | The Genetic Code
## The Genetic Code
- The RNA is complementary to the Template Strand
- The Non-Template Strand is the same as the RNA 
- Template->Non-Coding->Antisense->minus strand
- Template Strand: "coding positively makes sense" = 5-3 = +2

## Reading Frames can produce Alternate Proteins
- Reading frames are important because they allow us to communicate and have standards with other people
![[Pasted image 20250923130718.png]]
## A Gene uses one reading frame
- The first reading frame is determined by the start codon in the open reading frame and continues until the stop reading frame

## Simple Sequence with Three possible ORF's
