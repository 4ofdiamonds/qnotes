# Applied Lecture
## Flow of Information - A real world example
- Differences in genotypes allow for a change in the proteins which can allow for changes of color in forest mice or beach mice
- A minor change of one base pair can have massive changes the phenotypic ratifications

## The Genetic Code
- **Question**: Why do many assumed that the genetic code must have been established early in the history of life?
- **Answer**: Since all life on earth shares the same genetic code which means that chances are that the genetic code was the the first thing to evolve with life. This allows for genes from some animals to be implanted in other animals to create those proteins
## What are some exceptions?
### Paramecium
- In some ciliates, such as paramecium, the stop codons code for Glutamine

### Mitochondria
- The mitochondria have their own DNA which code for their own proteins

- In yeasts, CUA codes for threonine while in mammalian mitochondria CUA codes for Leucine
## Mutations
- **Question**: How does DNA transcription relate to genetic abnormalities?
- **Answer**: Many transcription errors result in acquired mutations in the RNA, which leads to errors in protein formation
## Retinoblastoma
- Retinoblastoma is the disruption of the RB protein. The RB protein when disrupted will no longer serve as the cell cycle break, and will initiate the development of cancer on the retinas
## Applied Concepts - Real World Example
- Liposomes have been used to delivery chemotherapy drugs to the any cancer affected areas and will reduce problems
## Health Conditions related to Transcription Error

## Applied Concept - Chemotherapy Drugs
- Some chemotherapy drugs will inhibit topoisomerases which will prevent the replication of DNA
- Some drugs also prevent the transcription which will prevent proteins from being created
## Cancer Research - Transcription Therapy

**COULD BE ON TEST**: REASEARCHERS AT MCMASTER ARE FAIR GAME ON TESTS
## Dr Juliet Daniels
- She discovered Kaiso, which is a gene which control cell proliferation and cell-cell adhesion
- If the Kaiso gene malfunctions in tumors will actually contribute to tumor progression and spread in humans
- She wants to discover why certain women are affected and what they can do to prevent it from developing in the first place
- **LOOK AT HER WEBSITE**
## Alumni Spotlight - Dr Shawn Hercules
- He discovered through big data that it wasn't affected by wealth or other social factors but purely based on race?
