# T2L4A - Translation and The Complex Proteome
## Mussels - Mytilus
- Mussels have adhesive "beards" which are able to stick onto rock faces in order to **prevent themselves from being attacked by predators**
- The beards are made of proteins shaped into thin strands called a thistle thread release. The thread will **quickly harden after it has been released**
- Scientists have considered using **bioengineered mussel glue in order to do surgery on a baby**
- This could spread even more applications such as broken bones
## Mytilus mussels – produce a strong “glue”
- The fiber are made out of proteins secreted by the muscular foot. 
- Some of the proteins are **keratin and other resinous proteins** to form an adhesive known as byssus
- By using a scanning electron micrograph you can see that there is a **fibrous core and a knobby coating** which helps it stick to the rock face
- Genetic engineers **insert mussel DNA into yeast cells and the yeast will start to translate the proteins**
- This can be used as a glue in wet environments
## Mytilus - Current Challenges
- Due to climate change, ocean temperatures are increasing which leads to less dissolved oxygen and more acidic water which threatens mussels
- This is because at **higher temperatures and higher acidity, proteins will denature** and the mussels are no longer able to secure themselves onto rocks
## Kermode "Spirit" Bear
- They are a genetic subset of black bears and there are only 400 of them in the world. 
- The white fur is a **recessive gene** in black bears which aids in finding salmon
- The bears are not albinos because they do not have pink eyes. They also do not share the face shape, thick fur, or webbed paws seen in polar bears
- The Kermode bears are American black bears with a **single nucleotide modified mc1r gene**
## Eden Atwood lives with Androgen Insensitivity
- Eden Atwood has androgen insensitivity which caused by a defective androgen receptor which creates a insensitivity to testosterone
- She is genetically a male (XY chromosome) but still is effectively a women.
- Instead of having a uterus in her reproductive organs, she actually has testicles which prevents her from having children
