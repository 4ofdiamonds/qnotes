# T2M1 - Transcription
---
# Unit 1 | Reading the Blueprint
## The central dogma
![[Pasted image 20250923011454.png]]
- **Gene Expression**: Described as the process in which DNA is read, turned into RNA and then into protein. 
- **Central Dogma**: DNA is able to be replicated into RNA multiple times and thus is able to create an endless amount of proteins
# Unit 2 | Transcription in Prokaryotes
## For Refence: 
- [[4.2 Transcription]]
## DNA is transcribed from a template strand
- DNA is matched with single stranded RNA which matches the exact base sequence of the non-template with the exception of the substitution of thymine and uracil
![[Pasted image 20250923011947.png]]
## DNA transcription has a start and end site
- RNA polymerase will bind onto the promoter region of the DNA and move towards from 5' to 3' until it reaches the terminator region where the RNA polymerase complex is disassembled 
![[Pasted image 20250923012315.png]]
## Transcription Initiation
- Prokaryotes have free floating DNA and is smaller, which means that it serves as a model for gene expression
- In Prokaryotes there exists a **TATAAT sequence** positioned **10 base pairs upstream (5')** sequences which serves as part of the promoter region
- **Consensus Sequence**: Represents the nucleotide sequence in the DNA that is found at this site rather than the only variation. It is derived by **comparing that particular region of a sequence in many different promoters and finding common elements or nucleotides.** 
- There are often **multiple consensus sequences** which are able to **enhance the rate of transcription**
- The process of transcription relies on the primary RNA polymerase, but the complex can be variable with the **sigma factor proteins** which **facilitate binding to the promoter region**
- The variation in the sigma factors will help it to create different genes by **identifying specific promoters** to the RNA polymerase to **assist with turning genes on and off** when needed
- Transcription begins when RNA polymerase binds with the **sigma subunits to create a holoenzyme which unwinds the DNA**

## Transcription occurs within RNA polymerase
- The RNA polymerase complex binds to the DNA region and opens up a transcription bubble where it can create an antiparallel RNA strand to create a RNA-DNA duplex, by reading in the 3'-5' direction and creating in the 5'-3' direction

## RNA polymerase is a molecular machine
- Once bound, the RNA polymerase will engage in open conformation and the structural features will separate, stabilize and restore the DNA template and non-template strand
- Ribonucleotides are able to enter the RNA polymerase and assemble to elongate the RNA transcript in sequential fashion
![[Pasted image 20250923021150.png]]
## Transcription Elongation
- Since DNA is rewound immediately after transcription, multiple RNA complexes are able to transcribe the same gene at the same time sequentially
![[Pasted image 20250923021441.png]]
## The RNA transcript elongates at the 3' end
- The Ribonucleotide triphosphate will have lots of potential energy released which is enough to create the phosphodiester bond in the sequence of RNA
- Once the diphosphate (pyrophosphate) is cleaved, the process is virtually irreversible
## Transcription has to stop
- Termination sites will promote the release of the RNA complex
![[Pasted image 20250923022048.png]]
##  Termination of Transcription
- Prokaryotes have two types of termination sequences
	- **Row independent termination sequences**: Inverted nucleotide repeat sequences (nucleotides are repeated, followed by the reverse compliment)
	- **GC rich hairpin loop**: The repeated sequences will fold onto itself after transcription which pauses the RNA polymerase and causes it to release
	- **Row dependent termination sequences**: Use specific protein or factor which will use ATP to move along the RNA transcript and unwinding it from the DNA template and destabilizing the bond to release it

## Prokaryotes, Transcription and Translation
- Translation can occur even before transcription is done because of the lack of nuclear envelope

# Unit 3 | Transcription and mRNA processing in Eukaryotes
## Transcription in Eukaryotes
- In eukaryotes, general transcription factors are required due to the increased complexity of the promoter region
![[Pasted image 20250923023317.png]]
- There are also 3 types of RNA polymerase
	- **RNA polymerase I**:  structural-noncoding RNA such as rRNAs
	- **RNA polymerase II**:  coding RNA such as mRNA
	- **RNA polymerase III**:  structural-noncoding RNA such as tRNA and other small regulatory RNAs
- The type of termination changes depending on what RNA polymerase is used
![[Pasted image 20250923023550.png]]
## A mRNA is a copy of DNA that leaves the nucleus
- The mRNA is for real just a copy of DNA that leaves the nucleus but it has to be modified before it can do so
![[Pasted image 20250923023738.png]]
## Addition of the 5' cap
- The addition of the 5' cap and the 3' poly-A tail is used to
	- Ensure the stability in the RNA upon its exit from the nucleus
	- Help with the initiation and binding to the ribosomes
	- Protects against ribonucleic enzymes
- **5' cap**: This occurs first and is the addition of a modified guanine (7-methylguanosine) with a methyl group through a 5'-5' linkage. 
- The terminal 5' phosphate is removed by a phosphatase enzyme
- Glucanosyl Transferase Enzyme will catalyzes the attachment of the 5' cap
- **3' Tail**:
