# T2M2 - The Genetic Code
# Unit 1 | The Genetic Code
## Deciphering the Code of mRNA
- Transcription is low key OP because you can create multiple copies of a gene and further regulate what type of protein you get from it
- We still need to figure out how to get to the protein from the mRNA
# Unit 2 | Defining a Codon
## Does one or two nucleotides make a codon?
- Gammo reasoned that having a one base code, or a two base code is not enough to code for 20 amino acids

## Does three nucleotides code for amino acids?
- This is the smallest amount of nucleotides to code for one amino acid which will end up creating redundancies due to the excess nucleotide combinations

# Unit 3 | Deciphering the Code
## A simple mRNA
- Nierenberg and Mati placed all the components required for proteins synthesis in tubes and a string of uracil's which ended up producing a protein of phenyl alanine only

- A later experiment found that alternating cytosine and uracil creating a serine and leucine alternating protein. This result confirmed three amino acids is necessary for one codon

- By shifting the reading frame they were able to test the different codons and their amino acids

# Unit 4 | The Standard Code
## The universal genetic code
- Since mRNA is always built 5'-3', the code is always read 5'-3'
- By replacing the uracil with thymine, we get the same codon sequence which would appear on the non-template strand, which makes sense to refer to it as the coding strand

## Only AUG codes for Methionine
- Methionine is the only amino acid coded by one codon, AUG which is also the universal start codon
- Tryptophane is also only coded for by one codon UGG
- There is redundancy in other amino acids
- It is important that the codons are unambiguous and each codon only codes for one amino acid to maintain proper protein production
- There are three translation stop codons
## The open reading frame
- **The open reading frame**: The reading frame starts at a start codon and ends on an end codon and shifts down three nucleotides each frame

# Unit 5 | Reading Frames
## Reading frames can produce alternate proteins
- There are three different types of reading frames possible which will yield different amino acid sequences

## Inserting a nucleotide disrupts the code
- Inserting a nucleotide will shift the reading frame by one and is referred to as a frameshift mutation
![[Pasted image 20250924045620.png]]
## Removing three nucleotides keeps the code
- A triple removal will not shift the reading frame and only displace one amino acid

# Unit 6 | RNA and the origins of life
## RNA and the origin of life
- tRNAs act as the intermediate between mRNA and protein and the rRNA is what facilitates the process
- certain RNA's like spliceosomes can also act as catalytic units
- The theory states the RNA was most likely the precursor to current life which is supported by the fact that RNA is so important to life
