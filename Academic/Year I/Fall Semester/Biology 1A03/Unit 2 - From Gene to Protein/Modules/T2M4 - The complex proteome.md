# T2M4 - The complex proteome
# Unit 1: From genome to proteome
## Genomic to proteomic complexity
- The proteome represents the full number of proteins expressed in all of DNA
- There are approximately 20-25000 genes in the human body but there are over 1,000,000 proteins encoded in our genome
- The ratio between proteome and genome is due to RNA processing and post-transcription modifications

## Reading, interpreting and processing a message
- Compartmentalization allows for more intricate control in the regulation of cellular processes
- Alternative splicing and post-transcriptional modifications contribute to the complexity of the proteome
- The proteome can change in response to various factors due to 
# Unit 2 | Detecting a Signal
## Cells detect changes in the environment
- There are many cells which can be sensitive and respond to stimulus 
### Example
- After having a meal, blood sugars spike, Beta islet cells of the pancreas will lead to a cascade of events to return the blood sugar back to normal
- In response to the increase of blood sugar, the pancreas will create a protein known as insulin
- **Insulin**: An effector protein which is created by pancreatic beta cells and can interact with target cells to decrease blood glucose levels
- The events from stimulus to cellular response is highly regulated

## Glucose is absorbed in the small intestine
- Following the meal, most of the glucose will be absorbed by the microvilli cells of the small intestine
![[Pasted image 20251001035531.png]]
## Absorbed glucose is transported to target regions
- The microvilli cells are associated with small blood vessels and that is how the glucose ends up in the blood stream
- Then insulin will be released as the effector protein to reduce blood glucose levels

# Unit 3 | The Release of Functional Proteins
## Protein production in the ER
- The dense endoplasmic reticulum is responsible for the production of the Insulin protein
- Insulin is regulated in both the transcriptional and translational levels
![[Pasted image 20251001040243.png]]
## Insulin processing
- The insulin protein is made up of 110 amino acids, but the functional insulin protein is only made up of 51 amino acids
### Experiment by Dorothy Hodgkin
- Using x-ray crystallography, she was able to find out that insulin is made up of two amino acid chains
	- Alpha chain: 21 amino acids
	- Beta chain: 30 amino acids
- This is achieved by modifying the 110 amino acid into the 21 and 30 chains
## Post-translational modifications of insulin
- **Preproinsulin**: The originally insulin protein coded for an acts as the precursor to insulin
- The preproinsulin is translated by membrane bound ribosomes and is processed within the ER
- The N-terminal signal sequence interacts with signal recognition particles to facilitate the translocation into the lumen of the ER where the signal sequence is cleaved to create the **proinsulin molecule**

- Proinsulin will then undergo folding in addition to the formation of three disulfide bonds
- A chaperone protein will aid in the folding of the protein
- Proinsulin is transported to the golgi apparatus which will cleave the protein into the A and B chains as well as a small C chain
- Now the N-terminal and C-terminal amino acid residues in the A and B chains are the ones which will bind to insulin receptors on target cells
## Other types of post-translational modifications
- Cleavage, Disulfide Bridges, Folding
- Covalent attachments of other molecules
	- **Phosphorylation**: reversible post-translational modification of a phosphate group to serine, threonine or tyrosine
	- **Methylation**: Covalent addition of a methyl group
	- **Acetylation**: Covalent addition of an acetyl group to a specific amino acid residue in a protein
- Degradation of entire proteins

# Unit 4 | Different protein forms are important
## Insulin binds to receptors on target tissues
- Once insulin is released it will bind onto important proteins known as receptor family known as receptor kinases
- Receptor kinases exist in monomeric form and when insulin binds to the receptors on the cell surface, the monomeric receptors will pair up (dimerize) which leads to the activation of cytoplasmic domains of the receptor which will act like kinase proteins
- Kinase proteins engage in phosphorylation of specific amino acids
- These kinase proteins will phosphorylate each other at many regions on the receptor tails and allow for the binding of other important cytoplasmic proteins
![[Pasted image 20251001042508.png]]
## Insulin induces the uptake of glucose
- Due to intracellular signal amplification, cytoplasmic proteins will become activated and lead to an intracellular response
- The signal ultimately leads to the activation of glucose transporter proteins and the cell will start to intake glucose
![[Pasted image 20251001042848.png]]
## Intracellular signals are amplified
- The signal is carried by a series of diverse transducer and amplifier proteins that are downstream from the activated receptor
- The initiation and maintenance of the signal is a positive feedback loop which will keep the signal on
- Many elements in the pathway can also activate the negative feedback loop which will result in signal termination
- The signal can also be double negative feedbacked which means the inhibitor can be inhibited which allows for an extra condition and more control over the activation of the extracellular signal
