## Change sin cell behavior the glucose effect
- **COULD BE ON TEST**: when the graph of the bacteria population flatlines, it does not imply that the bacteria are dying, it just means they are no longer reproducing4
- **COULD BE ON TEST**: IF YOU HAVE LACTOSE PERMEASE AND NO B-GALACTOSE WHAT WOULD THE POPULATION CURVE LOOK LIKE
## cAMP
- The enzyme that turns ATP into cAMP is inhibited by glucose. 
	- High levels of glucose = cAMP are low
	- Low levels of glucose = cAMP are high
## The lactose paradox- is the lac operon ever fully OFF?
- The lactose expression can never be fully off because then lactose would never be able to enter into the cell
## Dissociation of repressor protein allows for “burst” or operon expression
- When there is a change in the repressor protein, RNA polymerase is able to transcript a tiny little bit of mRNA to code for a small amount of proteins
