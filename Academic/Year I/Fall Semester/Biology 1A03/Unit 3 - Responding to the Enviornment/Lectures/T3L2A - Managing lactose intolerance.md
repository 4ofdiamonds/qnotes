Managing Lactose Intolerance 
Digesting Lactose 
- People use lactase (a type of β-galactosidase) to break down lactose 
 
- Glucose and galactose are absorbed by enterocytes

- Lactase hydrolyzes lactose to glucose and galactose
    

  

Extracting Energy from Lactose
![[T3L2A - Managing lactose intolerance-1761862990382.jpeg]] 

- In adult mammals, other than humans, lactase production decreases significantly after weaning 
    
- Around 65% of humans have a reduced ability to digest lactose after weaning
    

  

Lactose Tolerance 

  

Mutations 

- Mutations keep the lactase gene permanently on 
    
- Common in individuals whose ancestors had access to domesticated dairy animals
    
- Cows were domesticated between 7500-9000 years ago in the Middle East and North Africa, then brought to Europe
    
- Mutations arose randomly in the adjacent regulatory gene (MCM6) 
    
- Once it arose, it gave distinct advantages to these populations (enhancing lactase gene transcription throughout the lifetime) 
    

  

Common Populations with Mutations 

- The ability to digest lactose in adult humans has risen to high frequency in descendants from certain populations
    
- >90% in Swedes, Danes and pastoralist populations in Africa
    
- ~50% in Spanish, French and pastoralist Arab populations
    
- Low in non-pastoralist Asian and African populations
    
- However, most people with lactase non-persistence retain some lactase activity and can
    
- include varying amounts of lactose in their diets without experiencing any difficulty
    

  

Lactose Intolerance 

- Individuals can be born without the ability to express the lactase gene that codes for lactase protein 
    
- These individuals are unable to digest lactose (congenital lactase deficiency) 
    
- Results in excessive lactose in the intestine that attracts water molecules, which prevents water from being properly absorbed into the bloodstream
    
- Intestinal bacteria act on lactose (via fermentation)
    
- Leads to gas, bloating, cramps, nausea and diarrhea
    

  

Congenital Lactase Deficiency 

- The LCT gene on chromosome 2 codes for the lactase enzyme 
    
- LCT gene mutations in the coding region of the gene have been found to cause congenital lactase deficiency 
    
- Mutations are often changes that alter single amino acids or lead to polypeptides that are too short
    

  

Galactosemia  

- Galactose in the blood 
    
- Individuals who are born without the enzymes needed for galactose processing
    
- Sometimes confused with lactose intolerance
    
- Brought about by inherited mutations in the GALT, GALE, GALK1 and genes on chromosomes 9 
    
- Leads to almost no enzyme activity 
    
- Results in toxic accumulation of galactose, which can lead to organ and tissue damage 
    

  

Treatments

  

Galactosemic Individuals

- Omitting galactose consumption in the diet
    

  

Lactose-Intolerant individuals:

- Omitting lactose consumption in the diet or being selective with dairy consumption
    
- Take a lactase dietary aid, or pre-treat milk with purified lactase
    

  

Microbes and Dairy Products

- The production of dairy products like yogurt and cheese requires fermentation
    
- This is accomplished by lactic acid-producing bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Bifidobacteria
    
- These bacteria ferment carbohydrates in milk (Lactose into glucose and galactose) and produce lactic acid as a product
    
- Due to this, these products have lower lactose levels
    
- Acid precipitates protein in milk (producing cheese, yogurt, etc.) and can also prevent the growth of other “bad” bacteria and pathogens
    

  

Dietary Aids 

- Commercially produced lactase can be extracted from yeast, fungi, and bacteria 
    
- This enzyme is usually extracted from Aspergillus fungi (beta galactosidase-LacA), which has a similar action to human lactase
    
- The enzyme works in acidic environments (pH 3-6)
    

  

Industrial β-galactosidase production

- Lactose-free and lactose-reduced dairy products can also be produced 
    
- This involves pretreatment of the milk products with lactase, which is extracted from these various types of microorganisms
    
- This lactase enzyme usually comes from the Kluyveromyces yeast, where the enzyme can function at neutral pH (in the carton), and no longer acts to break lactose down when it reaches your stoma
    

  

Producing Lactose-Free Milk

- Milk is first passed through filters that remove 40% of the lactose in the milk
    
- From there, more lactase is added to the milk to remove any remaining lactose
