## Promoters recruit transcription factors and RNA polymerase
- Eukaryotes have a promoter per gene as opposed to prokaryotes who have a promoter for similar genes
- Regulatory Promoter Region: regions far from the promoter which promote transcription

## Trans-acting factors interact specifically with DNA
![[Untitled-1761064600667.jpeg]]
## Eukaryotic transcription is regulated
- Once transcriptional activator proteins bind to the promoter it will begin to assemble the transcriptional complex

## Transcriptional repressors can halt transcription
- If there is a repressor protein on the silencer site, it will stop transcription all together

## Transcriptional regulators determine cell types
- Certain genes will turn off or turn on to determine the cell type. (example beta-globin)

## In situ studies in gene expression
- Scientists will make a complimentary fluorescent DNA sequence which will bind to the mRNA to visualize if transcription of the genes are turned on

## Identifying differences in gene expression
- In larger eukaryotes it is only possible to do this technique in specific tissues by blowing up the cells and isolating the mRNA
- Cancer cells normally have a different physical appearance
- Scientists have been trying to turn off or on the certain genes which make a cell cancerous

## Preparing fluorescently labelled cDNA
- The mRNA is isolated from the normal and cancer cells and labelled green and red respectively through fluorescent nucleotide tagging

## Using a microarray chip to measure gene expression
- researchers will ask the company which genes they are interested in and will prepare the wells in advance
![[Untitled-1761066051358.jpeg]]
- They will fill the well with single stranded DNA which is anchored to the bottom of each well and the single stranded fluorescent strand will find its complementary gene in each well
- (1) All strands in a single well are identical, and (2) each well represents a different gene of interest

## Regulating eukaryotic gene expression
- 1. Histone Modifications: Regulating the amount of mRNA that is transcribed
- 2. DNA methylation: Regulating the amount of mRNA that is transcribed
- 3. mRNA stability: Regulating the amount of mRNA that is translated into proteins
- 4. Protein stability: Regulating the amount of time a protein can function in a cell
## Methylation near the promoter of a gene
- If there is methylation near the CpG island (cytosine area) will prevent binding of transcription factors

## Methylation promotes chromatin remodeling

## miRNA results in inhibition of translation

## siRNAs lead to mRNA degradation
![[Untitled-1761067117750.jpeg]]
## Protein degradation
- Proteasomes degrade unneeded or damaged proteins
- Ubiquitin will attach to a protein and will bring it to the proteosomes
