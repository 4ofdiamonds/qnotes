 ## Signals are detected by cells
- Cells are constantly receiving signals which influence development of the cell

## Signals are detected by cells
 - Epigenetics mechanism will remodel chromatin and change gene expression
## Epigenome
- Epigenetics "above the genome" because while the genome in inherited, the epigenome can be altered
### Mechanisms
- Modifications of histone tails (alters wrapping of DNA around histones)
- DNA methylation (alters ability of transcription factors and RNA polymerase to interact with promoter
## Epigenetic mechanisms and health
- A lot of diseases that were thought to be mutations, but can also be due to epigenetics

## Cancel cells have abnormal epigenomes
- Cancer cells have lower levels of methylation and have an increase expression of genes that promote cell growth
- Cancer cells have higher levels of methylation specifically on genes that restrict growth
- HeLa cells were taken from a woman with breast cancer and it is still dividing 70 years after while most cells are supposed to die after 100 generations

## Epigenetics and cancer
- This means that identifying mutations in cancer cells do not give us the full picture anymore

## Observing gene regulation in Agouti mice
- Two mice can have identical Agouti genes which can make them switch from producing black to yellow pigment
- If the gene was highly methylated, then the agouti gene, and other genes which dispose the mouse to diabetes and disease are turned off

## Why the difference? Pioneering epigenetic research
- Waterland and Jirtle found that a Agouti mother that consumed dietary supplements during pregnancy would result in more brown mice

## Maternal diet affects epigenetic gene regulation
![[Pasted image 20251022125509.png]]
## Pioneering epigenetic research
- Genetically identical littermates can range in color due to epigenetic variation established in the womb
- Maternal dietary supplementation of Agouti mice with methyl donors (folic acid, choline, vitamin B12) alters coloration and disease susceptibility

## Investigating epigenetics with identical twins
- Identical or monozygotic twins = 1/250 live births
- Occurs when a single fertilized egg divides into two separate embryos
- Identical twins inherit the exact same genes from their parents
## Theory: blastocyst collapse splits cell mass in half
- The blastocyst will collapse and the inner mass will split in half
## Comparison of DNA methylation
- Mapping DNA methylation in twins
- Younger twins will have similar amounts of hyper and hypomethylation
- Older twins will have more distinct and larger differences in methylation

## Portraits of gene expression in identical twin pairs
- Isolated RNA from 3- and 50-year old twin pairs
- Expression patterns of the 3-year-olds was almost identical
- 50-year-old twins had extremely different expression profiles (4x
as many differentially expressed genes)

## Factors influence our epigenome
- **Epigenetic drift**: Failure to transmit epigenetic information through successive cell divisions in our bodies
