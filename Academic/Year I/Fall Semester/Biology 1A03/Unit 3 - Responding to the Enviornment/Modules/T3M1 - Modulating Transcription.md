# T3M1 | Modulating Transcription
# Unit 1 | Prokaryotes and their environments
## Organisms respond to their environments
- Under favorable conditions and available nutrients, all cells have the machinery to grow and divide
## What is needed for prokaryotic growth?
- Prokaryotes in aerobic environments need:
	- Amino acids
	- Vitamins
	- Nucleotides
	- Carbohydrates
	- Optimal temperatures
- These conditions are not always constant and gene regulation is important in helping prokaryotes respond to the environment
# Unit 2 | Prokaryotic Gene Regulation
## Gene categories
- **House Keeping Genes**: genes that are always required and are never turned off
	- Structural proteins
	- RNA and DNA polymerase
	- Ribosomal proteins
- **Regulated Genes**: not always required and are turned on and off to adapt to the environment
	- Enzymes or proteins that bring changes in growth and division
## Running out of resources
### Example: E. Coli Cells
- When exposed to a limited amount of carbohydrates, E. coli will use glucose until it is used up and then will start digesting alternative fuel sources

- It is the products of glucose metabolism which will activate the switch between glucose and lactose use. 
- This prevents unnecessary production of lactose enzymes when it is not needed
- Once glucose is used up there is a period of time where the enzymes for lactose must be upregulated in order to produce lactose and cell growth is temporally paused

## The cell can metabolize lactose
- The cell will need to produce B-Galactosidase in order to digest lactose

## Changes in protein production
### Experiment Jacob and Monod:
- They grew E. coli in a lactose-free medium, added lactose, then removed it again while measuring the amount of B-galactosidase enzyme produced
- The production began and halted when lactose was added and removed

# Unit 3 | Levels of regulation
## Regulation occurs at different levels
- Gene regulation takes place at all different levels of production and if any of these steps are disrupted there will be no activated protein
![[Pasted image 20251005171142.png]]
- The variation of expression levels in any one gene depend primarily upon on level of regulation
## Transcriptional control
- Transcriptional control is done through regulation of the promoter to turn on and off transcription

## Translational Control
- Initiation of translation in eukaryotes occurs by the binding of the ribosome to the 5' GTP cap
- In prokaryotes Ribosomes will bind to and initiation translation at Shine-Dalgarno sequences
- The rate of production of the protein affects the amount of protein that is produced
- mRNA stability also impacts the amount of protein production

## Post-translational control
- The immediate polypeptide chain is not the active protein, but it must go through modifications such as
	- driving the assembly into complexes
	- the binding of substrates
	- the unmasking of enzymatic domains
	- 3d folding

## Why are there three levels of regulation?
- Certain ones are faster or more efficient
### Post-translational regulation is the fastest
- Proteins can stockpile and will only become activated once the appropriate signal is received
![[Pasted image 20251005180445.png]]
## Transcriptional regulation is the slowest
- This requires the synthesis of all the steps to get the protein which results in it being the slowest
- This is reserved for drastic changes in the environment

## Transcriptional regulation is the most efficient
- Transcriptional regulation is the most efficient with materials as it does not create anything that it does not need at that moment
