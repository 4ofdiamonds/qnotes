# T3M2 | Prokaryotic Transcriptional Regulation
# Unit 1 | Responses to the Environment
## E.coli cells receive environmental cues
- When E. coli detect a change in the environment, they are able to transition on the transcriptional level, to produce enzymes for lactose instead of glucose when it is required. 
## Transcriptional Response to the environment
- The two genes that are enabled once glucose is fully depleted is the gene for lactose digestion and intake

## Cues lead to gene expression products
- The two genes that are used are situated under the same operon in bacterial genome in order to efficiently create the necessary proteins when it is required

## Bacterial genes are clustered into operons
- In bacteria groups of functionally related genes are regulated under one operon
![[Pasted image 20251008120627.png]]
## The lac operon - a model for transcriptional regulation
- **LacZ**: the lactose enzyme B-galactosidase
- **LacY**: the lactose transport protein lactose
permease
- **LacO**: the lac operon
- **LacI**: the lactose inhibitor which binds to the lac operon

# Unit 2 | Negative Regulation of the Lac Operon
## The lactose operon is negatively regulated
- The Lac operon is negatively regulated by the repressor protein
- The default state is generally repressed because there is normally glucose
![[Pasted image 20251007130027.png]]
## Repressor protein creates a DNA loop
- The repressor protein is a tetrameric protein and once all 4 subunits bind the DNA will twist into an state where RNA polymerase can no longer start on the operon

## Lactose allosterically inhibits the repressor
- When glucose and lactose are present, the repressor protein will only be inhibited once the glucose has been fully depleted
![[Pasted image 20251007130630.png]]
## Lactose is an inducer of transcription
- When lactose is present in the cell, it will bind to the repressor protein and allosterically inhibit the protein to allow for transcription of the lactose proteins to continue

# Unit 3 | Positive Regulation of the Lac Operon
## E.coli cells receive environmental cues
- Not only is the lac operon negatively controlled, it is also positively controlled by cAMP which will increase in concentration in the cell
## cAMP as an indicator of glucose levels
- When there is a high concentration of glucose in the cell, it acts as an inhibitor for the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the production of ATP to ATP
- This means when glucose levels are low, cAMP levels are high and when glucose levels are high, cAMP levels are low
![[Pasted image 20251008115415.png]]
## Positive regulation of the lactose operon
- cAMP will bind to CRP or CAP (which stands for cAMP Receptor Protein or Catabolite Activator Protein) and acts as a transcriptional activator for the lac operon when it binds to the CRP-cAMP or CAP-cAMP binding site
![[Pasted image 20251008115723.png]]
## cAMP signals the nutritional state of E.coli cells
- cAMP acts as a allosteric activator for the CRP protein which will result in activation of transcription. This means if there is low glucose, the amount of lactose transcription will increase
- Lactose will bind to the repressor protein LacI to allow transcription of the operon to occur
![[Pasted image 20251008120327.png]]
## cAMP signals the nutritional state of E.coli cells
- If there is a large amount of glucose in the cell, there will be lower amounts of cAMP and results in low transcription of the lac gene even if there is lactose present in the cell
- This means the cell can use all the glucose before using lactose

# Unit 4 | Outcomes of Transcriptional Regulation
## Negatively regulated transcription
- The repressor protein can also be inhibited by a repressor protein to prevent them from binding to the DNA
![[Pasted image 20251008121745.png]]
## Positively regulated transcription
- The activator protein can bind to a activator binding site upstream, downstream or even overlap with the promoter, which promotes the binding of RNA polymerase
![[Pasted image 20251008121956.png]]
## When are levels of lac operon mRNA highest?
- The lac operon is most used at the highest point of bacterial density because that is when lactose is used as an active nutrient source
- The lac operon is very slowly used at point B because that is when it is just starting to be used
- The lac operon would be fully inhibited in A and there would be little to no production of lac genes
