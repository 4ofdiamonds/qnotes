# T3M2 | Prokaryotic Transcriptional Regulation
# Unit 1 | Responses to the Environment
## E.coli cells receive environmental cues
- When E. coli detect a change in the environment, they are able to transition on the transcriptional level, to produce enzymes for lactose instead of glucose when it is required. 
## Transcriptional Response to the environment
- The two genes that are enabled once glucose is fully depleted is the gene for lactose digestion and intake

## Cues lead to gene expression products
- The two genes that are used are situated under the same operon in bacterial genome in order to efficiently create the necessary proteins when it is required

## Bacterial genes are clustered into operons
- In bacteria groups of functionally related genes are regulated under one operon

# Unit 2 | Negative Regulation of the Lac Operon
## The lactose operon is negatively regulated
- The Lac operon is negatively regulated by the repressor protein
- The default state is generally repressed because there is normally glucose

## Repressor protein creates a DNA loop
- The repressor protein is a tetrameric protein and once all 4 subunits bind the DNA will twist into an state where RNA polymerase can no longer start on the operon

## Lactose allosterically inhibits the repressor
- When glucose and lactose are present, the repressor protein will only be inhibited once the glucose has been fully depleted

## Lactose is an inducer of transcription
- When lactose is present in the cell, it will bind to the repressor protein and allosterically inhibit the protein to allow for transcription of the lactose proteins to continue
