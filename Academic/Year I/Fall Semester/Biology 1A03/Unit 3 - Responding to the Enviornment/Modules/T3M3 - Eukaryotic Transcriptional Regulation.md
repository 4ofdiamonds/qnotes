# T3M3 - Eukaryotic Transcriptional Regulation
# Unit 1 | Cellular Differentiation
## All embryonic cells are identical
- All 200 different cell types in our body are derived from a singular zygote

## Cells acquire specific fates
- Cells arrange themselves into eukaryotic organisms by receiving signals which tell them to turn on and off different genes
- This will impact the embryos overall development
## Differentiated cells have distinct functions
- Certain cells can have certain genes turned on and off to carry out distinct functions

## Transcriptional regulators determine cell types
- Transcriptional regulators and transcription factors will determine the production of proteins, which in stem cells will allow the cell to differentiate into a specialized cell.

# Unit 2 | Chromatin Remodeling
## DNA compaction regulates gene expression
- DNA is organized into dense chromatin in eukaryotes which can change if a gene is read or not depending on how tight the winding is
- This is because the promoter regions which occur per gene are not able to be accessed and the DNA is not able to be unwound

## Nucleosome remodeling and accessing DNA
- 150 DNA base pairs can wrap around 8 histone proteins which prevents it from being replicated
- In order for transcription to occur, chromatin remodeling must take place which is triggered by activator protein or transcription factors binds to accessible enhancer site

## Histone modifications alter DNA winding
- 1. The positively charged tails of the nucleosome histone proteins interact with the negatively charged DNA 
- 2. Acetylation of the tails weakens their polarity and will allow transcription factors to bind to the DNA
- Activator proteins can recruit the coactivator enzyme histone acetyltransferase which will attach acetyl groups to lysine in the protein to reduce the charge

## Methylation and acetylation of histone proteins
- Methylation of lysine and arginine and phosphorylation of serine and threonine and alter the binding to the DNA
- A single methyl group can loosen the DNA, but three methyl groups can lead to the repression of transcription

# Unit 3 | Regulation Eukaryotic Transcription
## Trans-acting factors bind specifically to DNA
- Transcriptional factors have been researched to have certain shapes which are akin to the motifs of DNA,
- helix-loop-helix, helix-turn-helix, zinc finger and leucine zipper regions are examples
- The DNA can fit in with the alpha helix or the functional groups and once a strong enough conformational interaction is made it will begin recruit other transcriptional factors and RNA polymerase to being activation of transcription
