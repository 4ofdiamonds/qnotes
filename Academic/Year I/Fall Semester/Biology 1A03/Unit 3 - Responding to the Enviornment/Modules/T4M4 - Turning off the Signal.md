# T4M4 - Turning off the Signal
# Unit 1 | Global Gene Expression
## Analyzing gene expression
- The goal of gene expression is to have the right amount of product at the right time
- Gene expression is done through transcription initiation, RNA processing, the overall stability of the RNA molecule, protein synthesis, protein modifications and transport, and finally protein degradation
- Having multiple levels of gene expression allows for the cell to rapidly alter the levels of active proteins and respond to internal and external systems

## In situ studies of gene expression
- complimentary fluorescent probes are attached to mRNA to visualize where the mRNA is in a fruit fly
- Analyzing where the genes are can give a better understanding of temporal differences in development

## Visualizing expression levels of many genes
- Since entire genomes of animals are known, it is possible to set up glass slides that have known DNA sequences which will detect gene expression (transcriptome or or the set of mRNA transcripts that are expressed by various genes)
- Scientists can create microarrays with 100,000 oligonucleotides (short fragments of nucleic acids) which allow them to determine which mRNA is being transcribed
## Identifying differences in gene expression
- Visualizing which mRNA is being transcribed shows scientists which genes are currently being transcribed
- Cancer used to be classified on the organ they developed in, but with microarray experiments it can be used to differentiate between the patterns of gene activity between normal and cancerous cells

## Preparing fluorescently labelled cDNA
- Once mRNA has been isolated from the cells they can be used to make cDNA molecules using reverse transcriptase and different colored fluorescent nucleotides

## Labelled cDNA hybridizes with DNA on chip
- Placing the fluorescent cDNA on the microchip will visualize the hybridization because the relative differences in fluorescence color and intensity can be measured with special scanners

## Fluorescence analysis of gene activity
- If a microarray slot is a certain color, it means it is expressed in one and not the other
- If a microarray slot is mixed it means it is expressed in both colors
- Relative gene production can also be determined by intensity
- If there is a no color this means that a gene may be inactive and Computational software can further analyze the data from multiple microarrays and cluster genes that show similar expression patterns

# Unit 2 | Turning Off Gene Expression-RNA Stability
## Removing mRNA alters gene expression
- In order to remove gene expression, proteins and mRNA must be removed in tandem
- mRNA stability can be degraded through the length of the polyA tail

## miRNAs result in inhibition of translation
- a short, noncoding regulatory double stranded RNA molecule (microRNA) are transcribed from protein-encoding genes that transcribes other RNA molecules
- The microRNA will form hairpin loops because of complementary base-pairing within this microRNA precursor transcripts, and are then processed into smaller single stranded mRNA
- The microRNA will incorporate itself into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and will be used as a template to bind in a non exact manner the target mRNA which will be inhibited

## siRNAs lead to mRNA degradation
- small interfering RNA (siRNA) are created and part of a similar complex to the miRNA, but are a exact compliment of the target mRNA
- the siRNA complex will bind complementarily to the target mRNA and induce cleaving which destabilizes the mRNA and leaves it unusable
- siRNA have been used to turn off genes effectively and observe its role in the genome
- Misregulation of siRNA can result in various diseases
# Unit 3 | Turning Off Gene Expression-Protein Stability
## Protein degradation
- Selective degradation occurs in proteins when a proteasome breaks down a protein into its basic amino acids for it to be reused
![[T4M4 - Turning off the Signal-1761542713211.jpeg]]
## Protein degradation
- Ubiquitin proteins will perform a ATP dependent enzymatic reactions to create a polyubiquitin chain through ligation
- The ubiquitin tag will allow for the proteosome to breakdown the target protein through a ATP heavy reaction
- The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a mechanism that can turn off gene expression signals
- Proteosomes can degrade transcription factors, cell-cycle regulators, misfolded or aggregated proteins.
