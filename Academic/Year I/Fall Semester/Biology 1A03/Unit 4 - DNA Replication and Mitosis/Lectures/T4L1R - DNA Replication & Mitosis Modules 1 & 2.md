# Module 1 | The Cell Cycle
## Eukaryotic Cells Reproduce by Mitosis
- All cells arise from pre-existing cells by the process of cell division. Mitosis occurs in somatic cells. Producing daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell.
## Mitotic Cell Division
- Functions: Growth, Development, Repair
- Animals, Fungi, & Plants complete the Cell Cycle.
## Eukaryotic Cells Reproduce by Mitosis 
- Cell Cycle has 4 Phases.
- G1 phase (Interphase).
- S phase (Interphase)
- G2 phase (Interphase).
- Mitotic phase (M phase)
![[T4L1R --1761669525710.jpeg]]
## Phases of Interphase
- What occurs during the G1 phase?: Cell growth & duplication of organelles
- What occurs during the S phase?: DNA Synthesis (chromosomes are replicated)
- What occurs during the G2 phase?: Cell growth & duplication of organelles to build the protein “machinery”
## Significance of Gap Phases
- Why do Gap Phases exist?: Gap phases ensure that the parent cell is large enough in size & has the required organelles before mitosis occurs, so that the daughter cells will function normally
## Interphase, Mitosis, & Cytokinesis
- Chromosomes
- Microtubules
- Intermediate Filaments
![[T4L1R --1761669604076.jpeg]]
## Phases of Mitosis
- Know the structures, functions, significance of the Phases of Mitosis
![[T4L1R --1761669641656.jpeg]]
## Prophase 
- In the Nucleus: 
- Chromatin fibers contract (DNA condenses) by tightly coiling.
- Chromosomes are visible & each consists of two identical sister chromatids joined together at the centromere.
![[T4L1R --1761669693289.jpeg]]
## Prophase
- In the Cytoplasm
- Mitotic spindle forms.
- Assembly of microtubules begins in the centrosome (animals) and the microtubule organizing centre (plants). 
- In animals, the centrioles begin to move apart to opposite sides of nucleus (2 poles).
![[T4L1R --1761669728223.jpeg]]
## Prometaphase
- Chromosomes do not appear completely aligned or organized
- Spindle fibers attach to sister chromatids at the kinetochore regions
![[T4L1R --1761669741531.jpeg]]
## Microtubules during Cell Division 
![[T4L1R --1761669764599.jpeg]]
## Microtubules during Cell Division 
- What are the function of the kinetochore microtubules?: Assist with the movement of the chromosomes
- What are the functions of the nonkinetochore microtubules?: Forms a cage-like network, which facilitates the activities of the cell cycle components. Assist in elongating the entire cell during anaphase.
## Metaphase
- Chromosomes line up along the Metaphase Plate
- Centromeres are aligned on the metaphase plate, which is located equidistance from the two poles
![[T4L1R --1761669813480.jpeg]]
## A single chromosome in metaphase of mitosis
![[T4L1R --1761669844735.jpeg]]
## Anaphase
-  Binding proteins between the sister chromatids break down
- Centromeres of sister chromatids disjoin & segregate, this process is called Disjunctional Segregation , Chromosomes move centromere first (they appear V shaped), Cell elongates
- Count the number of centromeres
- COULD BE ON TEST: MIGHT ASK TO GO FORWARD OR BACK IN THE CELL CYCLE
![[T4L1R --1761669882603.jpeg]]
## Telophase
- Nonkinetochore microtubules further elongate the cell
- Two daughter nuclei form
- Formation of the nuclear envelopes around each set of chromosomes
![[T4L1R --1761670095462.jpeg]]
## Cytokinesis 
- Animals, Slime Molds, & Fungi Form a Cleavage Furrow
![[Pasted image 20251028124844.png]]
## Cytokinesis
- Plants Form a Cell Plate
![[T4L1R --1761670158531.jpeg]]
## Interphase, Mitosis, & Cytokinesis 
![[Pasted image 20251028124931.png]]
## Significance of Research related to the Cell Cycle
- Jointly awarded for their discoveries of the key regulators of the cell cycle
![[T4L1R --1761670196891.jpeg]]
## Cyclins Proteins and The Cell Cycle
- Cyclins are proteins that oscillate in concentration during the cell cycle.
![[T4L1R --1761670228073.jpeg]]
## Molecular mechanisms regulate the cell cycle
### Cyclins
- regulates cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) activity CDK (Cyclin Dependent Kinase)
- protein kinase, which uses ATP
- adds phosphate groups to protein
- induces conformational change
- to be active, it must be attached to cyclin.
- THIS DIAGRAM IS IMPORTANT FOR THE TEST

# Module 2 | DNA Replication
## Origins of Replication 
- Ori sites are the specific points where DNA replication begins
-  DNA double helix opens up at the origin to form 2 single strands
- Replication forks (Y shaped regions) spread in both directions from the ori sites
![[T4L1R - DNA Replication & Mitosis Modules 1 & 2-1761670751352.jpeg]]
## Continuous & Discontinuous Replication 
### Leading Strand
- Continuous synthesis, grows in 5’to 3’ direction, new nucleotides added only to 3’end.
![[T4L1R - DNA Replication & Mitosis Modules 1 & 2-1761670784443.jpeg]]
### Lagging Strand
- Discontinuous synthesis, grows in overall direction of 3’ to 5’ direction, however, note that it is produced by Okazaki fragments that individually grow in 5’to 3’ direction.

## The Replication Complex
![[T4L1R - DNA Replication & Mitosis Modules 1 & 2-1761670877339.jpeg]]
- Gyrase does not exist it is just called topoisomerase
- You have to know how to spell everything
- Know the structures, functions, significance.
## Lagging Strand synthesis requires Ligase
- Ligase: Catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds joining the new Okazaki fragments in the growing lagging strand.
