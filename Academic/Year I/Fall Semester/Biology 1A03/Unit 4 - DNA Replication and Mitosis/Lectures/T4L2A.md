## Microtubules during cell division
![[Untitled-1761756161306.jpeg]]
## Laser Beam Experiment
- They used fluorescent dyes to distinguish between the microtubules and they bleached out the fluorescent dye in the middle
![[Untitled-1761755904744.jpeg]]
- The microtubule will start to shorten at the chromosome and the photobleached area will stay in the same position due to kinetochores

## How do microtubules move chromosomes during mitosis? 
- The kinetochore will break down the microtubule which drives the movement towards to poles

## Johnson & Rao's Cell Fusion Experiments
- These experiments are not about the sequence and order of the cell cycle, just the impact of everything
- The role of this experiment was to figure out where cell cycle control enzymes were located

## Markert & Masui’s Microinjection Experiments
- In the experiment they injected two interphase cells with interphase cytoplasm and M-phase cytoplasm. The m-phase cytoplasm injection resulted in early spindle fibers appears.

## M-Phase Cytoplasm contains regulatory molecules that induces M phase in interphase cells
- M phase cytoplasm contains regulatory molecules that induces M phase in interphase cells. 
- TEST QUESTION: WAHT WOULD YOU OBSERVE IF YOU INJECTED CERTAIN CYTOPLASM INTO OTHER CYTOPLASM
## Canadian Cancer Statistics
- Knowledge of the cell cycle is extremely important because it is the cause for cancer. Cancer is the number 1 cause of death in Canada
- Vaping, Smoking, Alcohol all are cancer causing
## The Cancer Journey
- Primary Care
- Prevention
- Screening
- Diagnosis
- Treatment
- Recovery/Survivorship
- End of Life Care

## Normal Cells vs Cancer Cells
- Cancer cells are large in size, and have variably shaped nuclei.
- Cancer cells have many dividing cells, they are very disorganized in arrangement.
- Cancer cells have more variation in size and shape in comparison to normal cells
- Cancer cells also have lost normal features.

## Normal Cells exhibit Limited Growth
- Normal cells will grow if they have anchorage to the floor (anchorage dependence and density-dependent inhibition)
![[Untitled-1761757142230.jpeg]]
## Cancer Cells display Excessive Cell Division
- Cancer cells will grow on top of each other
![[Untitled-1761757171085.jpeg]]
## Characteristics of Cancer Cells
- cancer cells divide faster than normal cells
- uncontrolled cell division
- cell cycle is not regulated
- cell cycle checkpoints are disrupted
## Stages of Cancer

## Chemotherapy Drugs
- There is a huge interest in the field of ethnobotany. We can get anti cancer drugs from naturally occurring plants. Here are some examples:
- On the left is Vincristine, which is extracted from the rosy periwinkle that is native to Madagascar
- On the right is Taxol , which is extracted from Pacific Yew tree’s bark
- These extracts are anti-microtubule agents, which inhibit spindle fiber formation, which results disruption of mitosis.
- Since cancer is uncontrolled cell division, having a chemotherapy drug that interferes with cell division is needed.

## Novartis receives Health Canada approval of its CAR-T cell therapy Sept 2018
- “This first approval of a CAR-T cell therapy in Canada heralds the start of what promises to be a new age in the way cancer is treated. Novartis is working collaboratively with a number of treatment centres to build a delivery system that did not previously exist,"
## Novartis receives Health Canada approval of its CAR-T cell therapy, Kymriah™  Sept 2018
- CAR-T Therapy for Cancer
- CAR-T therapy  harnesses the potential of the individual's own immune system to target & destroy cancer cells.
- Remove blood from the patient to get T cells. Make CAR T cells in the lab. Grow millions of CAR T cells. Infuse CART T cells into the patient. CAR T cells bind to cancer cells and kill them.

## Prevention - Alcohol & Cancer
- The liver converts most of the ethanol is converted into acetaldehyde
- Acetaldehyde is toxic
- If too much alcohol is consumed the body, acetaldehyde then builds in the body
- Acetaldehyde can cause irreversible DNA damage, leading to cancer
![[Untitled-1761758162215.jpeg]]
- Consuming alcohol can use estrogen levels to increase which can lead to an increase of breast cancer
