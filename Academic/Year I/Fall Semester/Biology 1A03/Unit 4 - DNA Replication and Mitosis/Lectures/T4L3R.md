## Phase 1 Sequenced Fragments & Phase 2 Assembly
- The DNA already sequenced from sanger sequencing can be used to find the bigger part of the genome and the order of genes
![[Untitled 7-1762277782793.jpeg]]
## Assembly is based on Sequence Similarities

## Phase 3 - Annotation

## But only one reading frame codes for the protein

# Theme 4 Review
## A Point Mutation
![[Untitled 7-1762278497195.jpeg]]
## The Effects of Point Mutations
- Since there is a redundancy in the genetic code, a single nucleotide change in the 3rd position of a codon may not change the amino acid for which it is coded. If the amino acid sequence does not change, then the phenotype does not change

## Nonsense Mutation

## Small Deletions Remove Amino Acids

## Frameshift Mutations

## Chromosomal Duplications & Deletions
![[Untitled 7-1762278742021.jpeg]]
- There could sections of the chromosome duplicated
- And there can be sections of the chromosome deleted
## Chromosomal Inversions
- Chromosome inversions an result from mistakes during crossing over and results in changes in gene order along the chromosome
