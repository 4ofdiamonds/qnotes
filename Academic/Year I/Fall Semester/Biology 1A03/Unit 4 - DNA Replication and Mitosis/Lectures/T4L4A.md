# Module 1 Genetic Variation
## The human life cycle
- Gametes are haploid (n) in ploidy numbers

## Nondisjunction
![[Untitled-1762969134103.jpeg]]
- COULD BE ON THE TEST: PREDICT WHERE THE GAMETES ARE AND WHAT THE CHROMOSOMES ARE
- aneuploidy: an improper amount of chromosomes in a cell due to nondisjunction
## Amniocentesis & Chorionic Villus Sampling
- During the 16th to 18th week, sample the amniotic fluid and karyotypes can be made to test genetics

## How do you make a karyotype?
- First stimulate mitosis through phytohemagglutin at 37 degrees for 2-3 days
- Colcemid is added to the culture in order to stop metaphase which is when the chromosomes are condensed
- Centrifuge the sample and add a low salt solution to get rid of red blood cells and to swell the lymphocytes
- Stain the sample with Giemsa and examine under a microscope
- COULD BE ON TEST: EXPLAIN KARYOTYPE ANALYSIS

## Why are karyotypes useful?
- Useful for genetic screening and to detect number of chromosomes
## Alterations of sex chromosomes Klinefelter syndrome
- XXY
- More feminine development and taller stature

## Alterations in autosomes - Down Syndrome
- Alterations in autosomes can result in down syndrome which is trisomy 21

## Patau Syndrome - Trisomy of Chromosome 13
- Results in mental challenge, cleft palate, deaf and malformed organs
![[Untitled-1762969762389.jpeg]]
## Edwards syndrome
- Trisomy 18
![[Untitled-1762970086356.jpeg]]
- Small newborns, low sets ears, webbed beck, receding chin, and organ malformations
![[Untitled-1762970147608.jpeg]]
## Turner Syndrome
- X chromosome monosomy (the only viable human monosomy)
![[Untitled-1762970183101.jpeg]]
- Short in stature, webbed neck, shield like chest, internal sex organs do not mature, females are sterile
![[Untitled-1762970235702.jpeg]]
## Triple X chromosome
- XXX chromosomes
- Usually normal phenotype and fertile, others have variable expression
![[Untitled-1762970265423.jpeg]]
## Jacobs Syndrome
- XYY male karyotype
- normal male
- much taller than average
- normal fertility & intelligence
![[Untitled-1762970398604.jpeg]]
## Why do mistakes occur?
- These errors happen without prior genetic predisposition
![[Untitled-1762970509837.jpeg]]
- Frequency increase with the age and the number of births
![[Untitled-1762970635878.jpeg]]
## Normal cell vs Cancel Cell
- Cancer cells have extra copies and missing chromosomes
![[Untitled-1762970734303.jpeg]]
## Aneuploidy & Cancer
- There is a relationship between the predisposition to cancer depending on if you have aneuploidy
- This is because key genes might be missing that regulate cancer
- Activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumour repressors
## Research Advances
- Ghulam Mufti
- Emma visits Dr. Ghulam Mufti. Dr. Mufti takes Emma to the Microarray Laboratory, where he conducts his research.
- Dr. Mufti shows Emma a Genome chip and explains that the patterns displayed on the computer output indicates the different gene expressions for individuals with varying conditions.
- This will offer the hope of more customized treatments (personalized treatments) for those living with cancer and other health-related challenges.
## What is the Significance of DNA sequence variations?
- DNA sequence variations in humans may determine how humans: 
	- develop disease
