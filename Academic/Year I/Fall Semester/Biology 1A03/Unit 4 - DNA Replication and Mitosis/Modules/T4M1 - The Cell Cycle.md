# Unit 1 | Cell proliferation in prokaryotes
## Bacterial cell division
- Cell division acts as a reproduction in prokaryotes where they pass on an exact copy of their genome
## The process of binary fission
- Binary fission begins when a protein attaches the DNA to the inside of the cell membrane and begins replication
![[T4M1 - The Cell Cycle-1763843760871.jpeg]]
- While DNA replication occurs, the cell will elongate until the DNA attachment points are on opposite sides of the cell and then the membrane will constrict and cleave to create a new cell

# Unit 2 | The Eukaryotic Cell Cycle
## Dividing and non-dividing eukaryotic cells
- Stem cells in adults are only able to replace non-reproducing specialized cells
- For example, if there is a muscle injury, quiescent stem cells will activate to differentiate into myoblasts which will stop dividing after they become part of the tissue
![[T4M1 - The Cell Cycle-1763844277437.jpeg]]
## Eukaryotic cells reproduce by mitosis
- Eukaryotic cell division required more control because of more organized DNA
- S phase: synthesis phase where DNA is replicated
- G1 Phase: preparation for mitosis
- M phase: mitosis and cytokinesis
- G2 Phase: preparation for synthesis
- Cells will divide and varying rates, but some cells stay in the G0 phase between M and S phase where they stop dividing
![[T4M1 - The Cell Cycle-1763845073257.jpeg]]
## Stem cells differentiate into specialized cells
- Satellite cells stay in G0 until an injury occurs where they start dividing again, but after they become myoblasts they enter G0 again

## Phases of mitosis
- The phases of mitosis were discovered by Alexander Flemming in 1882 by staining salamander embryos
![[T4M1 - The Cell Cycle-1763845460462.jpeg]]
## Prior to mitosis, DNA replication
- In S phase, DNA is replicated and the newly synthesized DNA is modified, and compacted into a a chromosome.
- The centromere is fully replicated but is so small it appears fused together
- Even though the chromosomes are shown to be compacted, chromosomes are not compacted until mitosis occurs
- Throughout M phase the sister chromatids will move into two new cells

# Unit 3 | Chromosome Dynamics
## Prophase
- As cell transfer from G2 to M-phase, the chromosomes will begin to condense
- During prophase, centrosomes will form and form miotic spindles
![[T4M1 - The Cell Cycle-1763848241248.jpeg]]
## Prometaphase
- During prometaphase the nuclear membrane will break down and the miotic spindle will bind kinetochores, which  bind the sister chromatids centromeres together
- Polar microtubules will interact with each other to push the centrosomes away from each other
![[T4M1 - The Cell Cycle-1763849138506.jpeg]]
## Metaphase
- During metaphase the chromosomes will align in the center of the cell
![[T4M1 - The Cell Cycle-1763849499605.jpeg]]
## Anaphase
- During anaphase the kinetochore spindle fibers will shorten and pull the sister chromatids apart
- The polar microtubules will continue to push each other apart to elongate the cell
![[T4M1 - The Cell Cycle-1763849399683.jpeg]]
## Telophase
- During telophase, the nuclear envelope reforms, the spindle microtubules will depolymerize, and the chromosomes decondense
![[T4M1 - The Cell Cycle-1763849863275.jpeg]]
## Cytokinesis
- In animal cells, a contractile ring made up of motor proteins that contract bundles of actin fibers along the midline of the cell, which will fully cleave the cell apart
- In plant cells a new wall is formed to complete cytokinesis
![[T4M1 - The Cell Cycle-1763850229496.jpeg]]
# Unit 4 | Controlling Progression
## Cyclin proteins and the cell cycle
- In 1980s Tim Hunt added radioactively labeled amino acids to sea urchin eggs, and found a protein whose production cycled with cell divisions
![[T4M1 - The Cell Cycle-1763851036277.jpeg]]
## Cyclins control kinase proteins
- Kinases will phosphorylate proteins to activate or deactivate them, such as those involved in the cell cycle
- Cyclins will bind to Kinases in order to activate them to trigger other proteins in the cell cycle
![[T4M1 - The Cell Cycle-1763862285788.jpeg]]
## Multiple cycle-CDK kinases
- There are multiple different cyclins: 
	- G1/S-cyclin-CDK for G1 to S transition
	- S-cyclin-CDK to initiate DNA synthesis
	- M cyclin-CDK to initiate mitosis
![[T4M1 - The Cell Cycle-1763862526697.jpeg]]
## Checkpoints: is everything ok?
- There are checkpoints in place which will stop Cyclin if something goes wrong 
	- G1 checkpoint: End of G1, only undamaged DNA should be replicated
	- G2 checkpoint: End of G2, only when all DNA is replicated should mitosis begin
	- M checkpoint: During anaphase, only if all chromosomes are attached to spindle fibers
![[T4M1 - The Cell Cycle-1763862910870.jpeg]]
## DNA damage checkpoint
- p53 is a protein normally found in small amounts, but if DNA damage is detected, it is phosphorylated to produce cyclin to prevent the cell cycle
- Unattached kinetochores create a wait signal, which recruits spindle-assembly checkpoint proteins which are activated by lack of tension in the spindle fibers
- Once all kinetochores are attached, spindle-assembly proteins will disperse and separate will come in and break the sister chromatids apart
