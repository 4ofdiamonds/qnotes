## Model for semiconservative replication
![[T4T2 - Replication-1763865682007.jpeg]]
# Unit 2 | Evidence for the semiconservative model
## Support for semiconservative replication
- Meselsen and Stahl cultured E. coli and created template strands with heavier nitrogen, and replicated strands with lighter nitrogen
![[T4T2 - Replication-1763866454817.jpeg]]
- Meselsen and Stahl found that after one round of replication, the DNA made a band between the heavier and lighter, indicating it was a mix of both.
- They also found that it was not dispersive because after multiple divisions, two distinct bands were created, ones that were template strand and replicated, and ones that were only replicated

## Semiconservative chromosome replication
- Researchers were able to label nucleotides with fluorescent labels in eukaryotes, and they found that if one strand was labeled, the products would always be half labeled, or fully labeled

# Unit 3 | Replication DNA
## Initiating replication
- DNA replication begins at the beginning of S-phase
![[T4T2 - Replication-1763867841070.jpeg]]
## DNA synthesis occurs 5' to 3'
- DNA is read 3'-5' and created in the 5'-3' direction
- Each nucleotide is added on with a phosphodiester bond
![[T4T2 - Replication-1763867884409.jpeg]]
## Both strands are simultaneously templates
- RNA primers are attached to both strands simultaneously to initiate DNA replication
![[T4T2 - Replication-1763930107325.jpeg]]
## Continuous and discontinuous replication
- Leading strand: continuous DNA replication
- Lagging strand/Okazaki Fragment: The lagging strand is limited by the directionality of DNA replication and must use multiple RNA primers
![[T4T2 - Replication-1763930277694.jpeg]]
## The replication complex
- Various proteins bind together to create a DNA replication complex
- Helicase: breaks down hydrogen bonds to unwind DNA
- Single stranded binding proteins: prevent DNA from binding back together
- Topoisomerase: bind upstream to prevent torsional strain
![[T4T2 - Replication-1763931103086.jpeg]]
- RNA polymerase: attaches RNA primers to the template DNA
- DNA polymerase III: does most of the elongation work
- DNA polymerase I: removes the RNA primers and replaces it with DNA
![[T4T2 - Replication-1763931286702.jpeg]]
## Lagging strand synthesis requires ligase
- Ligase is able to join the 3' end of the DNA fragment to the next DNA nucleotide by catalyzing a phosphodiester bond
![[T4T2 - Replication-1763931496460.jpeg]]
## Proofreading DNA
- DNA polymerase can proofread the DNA as it is adding nucleotides, and can remove the incorrect one and replace it with the right one
- Despite these measures errors in replication still exist

# Unit 4 | Replicating Eukaryotic Chromosomes
## Origins of replication
- Eukaryotes have multiple origins of replication, while prokaryotes have only one which goes around the whole circle
- Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes both have leading and lagging strands, both required replication complexes, and both replicate 5' to 3'
![[T4T2 - Replication-1763931998695.jpeg]]
## Replicating the ends of linear DNA molecules
- Since eukaryotic DNA is linear, it is impossible for the lagging strand to replicate 5' ends of the DNA
![[T4T2 - Replication-1763932153464.jpeg]]
## Replicating the ends of linear DNA molecules
- DNA will grow shorter each round of replication
![[T4T2 - Replication-1763932216443.jpeg]]
## Telomeres contain repeated DNA sequences
- The ends of chromosomes have telomeres which are long sequences of TTAGGG tandem repeats and acts as a buffer for chromosome shortening
- Gametes have telomerase enzymes which lengthen the end of telomeres
![[T4T2 - Replication-1763932338913.jpeg]]
## Telomerase elongates telomere regions
- Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein and a type of reverse transcriptase which contains a part of the RNA
- The telomerase is able to bind to the end of the telomere and catalyzes the extension of the template strand and after the daughter strand will complete replication
- Telomere length is related to the process of aging and cancer progression
