# Unit 1 | How Common are Mistakes?
## Mutation rates vary across organisms
- Mutations occur in proofreading abilities as they are normally corrected
- Viruses have the highest mutation rate due to the delicate nature of the RNA backbone and because they do not have proof reading capabilities

## Somatic versus germline mutations
- Somatic mutations occur in cells within an individuals body, and the earlier it occurs in the lifespan, the larger the area of affect is
- Germline mutations are mutations in gametes which can be inherited unlike somatic mutations

## Mutations are random
- Joshua and Esther Lederberg in 1952 grew bacteria, and stamped them on to a tray with penicillin 
![[T4M4 - DNA Mutations-1764000196394.jpeg]]
- Only some bacterial colonies survived, but they wondered whether it was because they already evolved to survive or if the environment induced their mutation
![[T4M4 - DNA Mutations-1764000356606.jpeg]]
- The bacteria from the original dish were measured to already have had the mutation which allowed it to survive which concluded that the mutations happened by chance
# Unit 2 | DNA repair
## DNA damage: causes and consequences
- Mutations occur frequently and if left uncorrected they can cause cell death, cancer, aging and disease
- Most cells have enzymes which can repair DNA such as DNA ligase

## Mismatch repair- identifying a mistake
-  Mismatched nucleotide sequences will cause a kink in the DNA backbone which will allow proteins to detect, and remove the error
![[T4M4 - DNA Mutations-1764025590447.jpeg]]
## Mismatch repair - repairing the gap
- One enzyme will cut the region around the DNA, another enzyme will remove the DNA sequence, and DNA polymerase and ligase will replace the sequence
![[T4M4 - DNA Mutations-1764025685481.jpeg]]
## Base excision repair
- If a uracil is detected, DNA uracil glycosylase will come in and cut the uracil out, leaving a backbone with no base
- AP endonuclease cleaves the backbone and removes the sugar
- Other enzymes will close the gap and replace the correct base pairing

## Nucleotide excision repair
- If a series of nucleotides are damaged, they signal a repair process which will excise and replace the string of nucleotides

# Unit 3 | Mutations in the nucleotide sequence
## A point mutation
- A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) occurs when DNA proof reading fails and the single base pair mutation gets replicated
![[T4M4 - DNA Mutations-1764026288694.jpeg]]
## The effects of point mutations
- Nonsynonymous: Some mutations can cause massive changes in the polypeptide chain and cause protein deformations
- Synonymous: Other mutations will have no effect due to the redundancy of the genetic code
![[T4M4 - DNA Mutations-1764026374227.jpeg]]
## Nonsense mutation
- When a point mutation codes for a stop protein and creates a nonfunctional protein
![[T4M4 - DNA Mutations-1764026544390.jpeg]]
## Small deletions can remove amino acids
- The degree of impact is dependent on how many amino acids are deleted or inserted
![[Pasted image 20251124182506.png]]
## Frameshift mutations
- If a deletion or insertion is not a multiple of three, then it will cause a complete change in amino acid sequence and often results in a nonsense mutation at some point
- Frameshift mutations are the most nonfunctional

# Unit 4 | Chromosomal Mutations
## Chromosome duplications and deletions
- Deletion: when a chromosomal fragment is last which can lead to a loss of genes, or if the centromere is lost, then the entire chromosome will not longer be able to be replicated
- If chromosomal deletion occurs, the homologous chromosome may be able to continue creating enough proteins
- If a chromosomal deletion occurs in a embryo, it will most likely lead to embryo death
- Duplication: sometimes genes get duplicated which in most cases will give an advantage depending on the gene
- Duplication and divergence occurs when a gene is duplicated and mutated and creates a new, similar gene
![[T4M4 - DNA Mutations-1764027196110.jpeg]]
## Chromosomal inversions
- Inversions occur when a gene breaks off and reattaches in the reverse direction, which normally does not cause too many issues, but can hinder gamete formation
- Inversions are common in large populations and explains how the order of genes in related species can vary 
![[T4M4 - DNA Mutations-1764027344248.jpeg]] 
## Reciprocal translocations
- Reciprocal translocation occurs when two non homologous chromosomes exchange parts of their structure, normally split along a non coding region which results in no visible changes
- Translocation can be an issue because passing on a faulty chromosome can affect the development of the offspring
![[T4M4 - DNA Mutations-1764027608645.jpeg]]
# Unit 5 | Variation and gene evolution
## Gene evolution
- The different globin genes has different expressions in fetus and adults, and each gene is similar enough to each other which is an indication that the original globin gene was duplicated and mutated to make the other globin variations
