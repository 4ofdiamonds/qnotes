Figure 2. Found that obese prone pre-dietary treatment had approximately 90% more enzymatic activity compared to the control (C) and obese resistant (OR) individuals, while obese prone (OP) individuals had 33% of the enzymatic activity compared to obese resistance. Enzymatic activity increased by approximately 270% in obese resistant individuals after dietary treatment, and by approximately 40% decrease in obese prone individuals. The significance of the data is p<0.05.
