## Types of SNPs
![[T5L1R-1762882668173.jpeg]]
- Linked SNPs: located near genes but do not affect the actual protein and act as markers 
- Causative SNPs: affect the way protein functions correlating with a disease. 
- A non-coding SNP changes the amount of protein produced
- A coding SNP changes the amino acid sequence
## Variations - From genotype of phenotype
- COULD BE ON TEST: KNOW HOW TO WRITE GENOTYPES

- Heterozygous individuals actually have advantages of both parts
## Detecting SNPs
![[T5L1R-1762883166430.jpeg]]
- COULD BE ON TEST: KNOW EXACTLY WHAT A HAPLOTYPE IS
## A single VNTR may have many alleles
![[T5L1R-1762883729914.jpeg]]
- The longer the VNTR is the slower it will move during gel electrophoresis
## Key Points
- SNPs & VNTRs
## Mendel’s 2nd Law – Independent Assortment
- COULD BE ON TEST: KNOW MENDELS LAWS
