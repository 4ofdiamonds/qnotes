- LINKAGE MAPPING WILL BE ON THE TEST
## Concepts defined
- Linkage: 2 genes close together will be inherited together
- Linkage maps: Diagrams that show positions of genes along chromosomes. This allows to see recombination frequency
## Genes are in a linear sequence on a chromosome

## Two copies of the X- chromosome (genotypic female)
Genotype: D-DB, d-db
![[T5L1R-1763487489965.jpeg]]
## We can track inherited alleles through a pedigree

## How do we pass on our alleles?
![[T5L1R-1763488176908.jpeg]]
## Segregation of chromosomes = segregation of alleles

## Recombination between non-sister chromatids during prophase 1
- Crossing over between sister chromatids never occurs, only between homologues
![[T5L1R-1763488551045.jpeg]]
## Crossing over: between double-stranded non-sister chromatids
![[T5L1R-1763488814199.jpeg]]
## Recombination frequency depends on the distance between genes
