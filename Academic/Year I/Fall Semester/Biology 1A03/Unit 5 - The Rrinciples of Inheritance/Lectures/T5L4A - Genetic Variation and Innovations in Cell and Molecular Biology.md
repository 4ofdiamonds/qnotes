## Composition of blood
- Hematocrit analysis: Centrifuging of blood to separate blood, white blood cells and plasma

## Bone marrow stem cells make red blood cells
- It takes 7 days for a stem cell (self-renewing) to turn into a blood cell which takes place in the bone marrow
- Red blood cells only last 120 days
- Depending on how much oxygen is available, the body will signal to create more red blood cells from stem cells
- The committed cells will signal to create hemoglobin, and 2 days after the nucleus will remove its own nucleus and the cell has 120 days left of genetic material left to live
- Red blood cells will start to become mature once they enter into the blood stream

## Red blood cells are oxygen carriers!
- Each hemoglobin molecule heme group has iron which will get oxidized by oxygen which turns it red
- Each hemoglobin molecule has 270 million hemoglobin
- In a capillary the red blood cells will line up, and pick up oxygen very fast once passing through the capillary

## Inheritance of red blood cell type
- The ABO gene codes for a gene which codes for an enzyme which will produce A or B type sugars for the blood cell

## Blood types - not all red blood cells are the same

## When does red blood cell type matter?
![[T5L4A - Genetic Variation and Innovations in Cell and Molecular Biology-1763593449980.jpeg]]
- The antigens must match the Antibody coded on the body
## We determine red blood cells types through "blood typing"

## Innovative research in blood science
- Dr. Stephen Withers found a way to turn any blood into O type blood
## How did they do it? Inspiration from gut microbes
- Hut microbes are able to break down the glycoprotein mucin which is found inside our intestinal tract to get energy
- We can use the bacterial enzymes to break down the antigens on the blood

## Does this mean we can start making "universal" donor blood?
- Right now it is in preclinical trials
- It does not stop there, because organ transplants are even harder than blood transports
- This means that we can create universal organs which can be transplanted into any person
