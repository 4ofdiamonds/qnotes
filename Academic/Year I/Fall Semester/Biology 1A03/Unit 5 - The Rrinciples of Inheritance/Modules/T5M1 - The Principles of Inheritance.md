# Unit 1 | Genetic Variation
## Different sequences lead to genetic variation
- **Tandem Repeats**: several thousand nucleotides in length and be present next to each other in multiple identical or near identical copies
- **Simple-sequence**: repeats as short as 2 nucleotides
- Changing a non-coding region will have a smaller affect on a cell compared to a coding region

## DNA polymorphisms and genetic variation
- DNA polymorphisms are single nucleotide variations or tandem repeats length variations and result in alternative forms of a locus (alleles)
- Most polymorphisms take place in the non coding region of DNA
- Non-coding DNA polymorphisms allow for high density genetic maps and are referred to as genetic markers

# Unit 2 | Detecting Variations
## Detecting SNPs
- Single nucleotide polymorphisms are one of the most common types of genetic variation and are the reason for phenotypic variation between individuals
- High frequency SNP is considered as 1 in 350 bp
- SNP found in a non coding region close to a gene can be used as a genetic marker
- SNP variations are transferred from parent to child
- Microarray analysis with common variations are used to detect which SNP is present
![[T5M1 - The Principles of Inheritance-1762757778805.jpeg]]
- The microarray analysis will often use fluorescent labelling to detect the results and also to check weather an individual is homozygous or heterozygous
- SNPs generally don't cause diseases and are just variations in an individual compared to a population

## Variable number tandem repeats
- Variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) will vary greatly between individuals and species and individuals
- PCR and gel electrophoresis can be used to measure VNTR length

## Detecting VNTRs with PCR
- Detection of VNTRs is often used for DNA fingerprinting as people are very unlikely to have the same amount of VNTR length

# Unit 3 | Variation and Disease
## Variations: from genotype to phenotype
- Sickle cell anemia phenotype is observed to be a alteration in the hemoglobin which prevents oxygen from being carried around the body efficiently
- Everyone carries two beta-globin alleles which means they are homozygous for the HbA allele
![[T5M1 - The Principles of Inheritance-1762758862349.jpeg]]
- The HbS allele is characterized by a SNP which results in a substitution of glutamine to valine which results in a change in the folding of the hemoglobin when an individual has two HbS alleles
![[T5M1 - The Principles of Inheritance-1762758977600.jpeg]]
- If an individual has both HbS and HbA, both will be produced but enough functional hemoglobin will be produced to see a normal phenotypical outcome

# Unit 4 | Variations in populations
## Beta globin variations
- Sickle cell anemia can be beneficial to protecting an individual against malaria
- Different regions have independently developed sickle cell anemia
- Multiple haplotypes (different alleles) can be found in one nation while one haplotypes can be found in different nations

## Variation in gene copy number
- Certain genes can be duplicated or deleted which can change the copy number variation (CNV)
- Microarray analysis will show different relative intensities to determine gene copy number
![[T5M1 - The Principles of Inheritance-1762760831678.jpeg]]
## Effect of gene copy number of phenotype
- Gene copies are normally found close to each other on the chromosone
- AMY1 has been duplicated many time in varying amounts depending on ancestry consumption of starch
