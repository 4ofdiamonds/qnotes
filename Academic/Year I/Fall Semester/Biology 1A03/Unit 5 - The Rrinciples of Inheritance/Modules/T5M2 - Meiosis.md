# Unit 1 | The Inheritance of Chromosomes - Meiosis
## Gametes - passing genes to the next generation
- Gametes are created in order to spread genetic material to offspring
![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762842130012.jpeg]]
- Meiosis will create haploid cells which can combined to form diploid cells
- Interphase occurs in both mitosis and meiosis which allows for the duplication of chromosomes
## Prophase I - Condensation and synapsis
- The chromosomes will condensate and homologous pairs will connect together through synaptonemal complexes
![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762842401961.jpeg]]
## Prophase I – Chiasmata
- The chiasma is the x shape that non sister chromosomes of homologous pairs create in order to commence crossing over
![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762842629166.jpeg]]
## Prophase I - Recombinant Chromatids
- Sister chromatids are genetically identical and have been duplicated for the purposes of cell division
- Non-sister chromatids are non genetically identical and come from maternal and paternal origins
- The Non-sister chromatids will break apart and recombine to create recombinant chromatids which are genetically unique
![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762842875597.jpeg]]
## Meiosis I - reductional division
- During meiosis one, the homologous recombinant chromosomes will separate in a random order which will cause a greater amount of randomness in genetic determination
- The synaptonemal complexes which break down and allow for the separation of the 46 chromosomes into 23 chromosomes in each daughter cell
![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762843398544.jpeg]]
## Meiosis II – equational division
- No new chromosomes are duplicated and the nuclear envelopes are immediately broken down
- The non genetically identical sister chromatids line up on the metaphase plate to get ready for separation in anaphase
![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762843769820.jpeg]]
## Abnormal variation in chromosome number
- Sometimes nondisjunction occurs where the sister chromatids stay together which create deletions or additions of chromosome numbers

# Unit 2 | Mendelian Inheritance
## Mendel studied traits in pea plants
![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762844375928.jpeg]]
# First generation cross
- P generation: the parental generation. In medals experiments they were pure bred
- F1 generation: the first generation down which was a cross of the p generation
- Mendel cross a pure yellow and pure green pea which resulted in only yellow children
![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762937011055.jpeg]]
## Second generation cross
- If the blended model was correct, the peas would be an average color of the two parents but this was false
- In the second generation cross the peas produced a 3:1 ratio of yellow to green

## 3:1 ratio in F2 generation
- Mendels first law of segregation: two alleles of a gene segregate (or separate from each other) into different gametes during gamete formation in both parents
- This means that different alleles will not be dependent on each other for selection (the allele will be found in all gametes)
## The Punnett square ![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762937499932.jpeg]]
## Punnett square: Hypothesis for 3:1
- If there the p generation is homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive, the f1 generation will be just be a heterozygous haploid type
![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762937655974.jpeg]]
## Punnett Square: Hypothesis for 3:1
- Since the two f1 generations will be heterozygous the f2 generation will have a 3:1 ratio
![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762937679977.jpeg]]
- for the genotypic ratio, there will be a 1:2:1 ratio of AA:Aa:aa
![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762937737748.jpeg]]
## Testing the 1:2:1 hypothesis
- When crossing a dominant and a heterozygous peas, you will get a 1:1 Aa:AA ratio which can be used to test heterozygous peas
![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762937810156.jpeg]]
## Mendel's first law
- Mendels first law can be attributed to meiosis II when the alleles are separated from each other
![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762937926919.jpeg]]
## Unit 3 | Independent Assortment
## Examining the inheritance of two traits
![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762938428446.jpeg]]
## Possible genotypes
![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762938452632.jpeg]]
- The law of independent assortment of genes comes from meiosis I where homologous chromosomes can migrate to either pole independent of each other
- This means if genes are on the same chromosome they are generally considered linked because this law will now apply
![[T5M2 - Meiosis-1762938584564.jpeg]]
# Unit 4 | From gene to protein
## Mendes's second law - independent assortment
- The gene responsible for the texture of the pea was the SBE1 gene which coded from an enzyme that broke down starch.
- The wrinkled peas are due to different concentrations of water due to different levels of glucose present
