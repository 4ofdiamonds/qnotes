## Inheritance observed in family histories
- Pedigrees can be used to track inheritance of genes

## 23 chromosomes, > 20,000 protein-coding genes
- Since there are 20,000 protein coding genes and only 23 chromosomes, it must mean that alleles can unlink from the gene and recombine in different combinations
# Unit 1 | The inheritance of genes on the X chromosome
## Sex Chromosomes
- The Y chromosome is much smaller and shares 25 proteins (half of which code for sex) while the X chromosome has around 1100
- This means there are many sex linked genes where the phenotype is connected to the sex because no recombination can occur

## Inheritance of sex chromosomes
- Mendel's laws do not hold for sex chromosomes because pea plants do not have sex chromosomes

## X – linked inheritance of color-blindness
- The color blindness gene is present as a recessive allele on the X chromosome
- Males will express the phenotype if their mother was a carrier since they get their sex linked genes from their X chromosome (hemizygous)
- Females will only express the phenotype if they are homozygous
- Hemizygous traits do not follow the rule of dominance and recessiveness

## Segregation of alleles on the X – chromosome
- There is only a 50% chance that a male baby inherits color blindness if their mother was a carrier

## X - linked inheritance in hemophilia
- Hemophilia where blood clotting does not happen properly is also X-linked
![[T5M3 - Sex Chromosomes and Linkage-1763238090329.jpeg]]
## X – linked inheritance of hemophilia
- There is a 50% chance to express hemophilia as a son of a carrier and a 50% chance to become a carrier as a daughter
- In order for a female to express it, her mother would have to be a carrier and her father would have to express it

# Unit 2 | Genetic Linkage
## Linked genes on the x - chromsome
- Genes that are positioned closely to each other on the same chromosome are considered to be linked genes and are often inherited with each other (either homologous or sex chromosomes)
![[T5M3 - Sex Chromosomes and Linkage-1763238490028.jpeg]]
## Recombination of homologous chromosomes
- Linked genes can be separated through crossing over but it is not as likely as non-linked genes on the same chromosome
![[T5M3 - Sex Chromosomes and Linkage-1763238568319.jpeg]]
## Recombination of alleles
- The recombination of linked genes is dependent on the distance between them
- Genes that are located closer together will not be recombined as often and their alleles will have the more less recombination frequencies

# Unit 3 | Constructing Linkage Maps
- A frequency map can be used to determine the relative distance on a chromosome genes are to each other
- If hemophilia and color blindness are inherited at a certain percentage, the frequency can tell us the relative distance on the chromosome. It was found that they are around 12 map units or 12 million base pairs apart

## Genetic Mapping in humans
- The millions of SNPs in non coding regions can determine the specific location of the gene on the chromosome
- If we look at the association frequency of marker A and B, we find that A has a higher association with the gene because of the proximity
- Marker B has normal Mendalian ratios because of the distance

## Genome-wide Association studies
- Analyzing mass populations can be used to associate genes and phenotypic characteristics by observing SNPs and their frequency with said characteristics
- The HMGA2 protein has been found to change height up to 1cm through one SNP mutation
