# T5M4 - Our Personal Genome
## Our personal genome
- Only about 2% of our DNA codes for functional proteins or small regulatory RNA molecules
- The biggest variation comes from the different haplotypes and different allele combinations
## Cellular proteomes
- The variation of proteomes are what are responsible for the phenotypic and cellular differences expressed in individuals
# Unit 1 | The importance of genetic variation
## Variations that affects cell function
- Variations in genetic material can have large affects on proteins which can either have a positive or negative affect the body
- Example: Sickle Cell Anemia
## Variations that does not affect function
- Some variations do not affect function such as different blood types, where only the cell surface proteins are changed which does not affect general function

## Alleles are inherited
- The ABO gene which codes for different blood types does so through production of specific glycosyltransferase which is mutated to add A or B agglutinogens on the cell surface
- The O variation results in an inactive glycosyltransferase
- The two allele copies determine what blood type an individual will have

# Unit 2 | When variation becomes beneficial
## Viruses hijack cell machinery during infection
- Mutations can be beneficial as it allows the cell to adapt to the environment if the mutation is helpful

## Variation may be an advantage
- Some people have 32 base pair deletions which change the receptor protein
- The reason why so much of the population has this mutation is because of the selective pressure from previous diseases

# Unit 3 | Microbiome
## The human microbiome
- The microbes in your microbiome help to break down food in your digestive system and produce vitamins
## Genetic diversity of microbiomes
- There are 3 million different species of bacteria which is another source of genetic diversity within humans
- The microbiome changes not with ancestry, but with diet which acts as a fast response system to the environment and exposure to pathogens
