## What is Biomechanics
- Physics and Biology together
- Can be the grandeur level with forces and angles on the body
- Can also be in muscle and cellular biology as well
## My journey
- University of Regina (Bkin)
- University of Calgary (Phd)
- Postdoc at UBC and UofC
- McMaster University (Assistant prof)
# Academic
## BKIN - Biomechanics and plyometrics
- Collecting data on athletes and plyometric performance
## MSC - Wearable sensors and aging
- Grad school gives you the opportunity and freedom to explore and accomplish many things
- Somehow you feel like you know less than you did at the start
## PHD - Wearables and osteoarthritis
- In osteoarthritis there is less space between the joints which causes bone-bone contact
- One of the solutions is a knee replacement
- Exercise is the most recommended conservative treatment
- Gait+Function = 80-85% classification accuracy
## Background
- Identify your path as early as you can and aim for it!
	- Industry: Internships, networking, industry focused project/skills, etc
	- Academia: Build you CV with publications, scholarships, grants, and some teaching experience
- Biomechanics + osteoarthritis is big, but the clinical impact is still limited
- Scientific computing and machine learning are keys skills
- Needed to further expand my skills and experience
## Tracking Data
- Wearable technology can be combined with AI in order to find better patterns in data
## McMaster university biomechanics lab
- Research focused
- Making human movement analyses more accessible and relevant for those who can benefit from them
## Gait analysis technology could help...
- Gait technology can be used to help with osteoarthritis
- Same tracking technology which is used for motion capture with video games
## Biomechanical data for OA
- Equipment is expensive and time consuming. 
- Total time is 46 minutes
- Another 2 hours processing the data
## Artificial intelligence to the rescue
- Markerless motion capture: relies on computer vision where an algorithm learns to recognize images based on large amounts of input data
- Integrates multiple cameras to automatically record biomechanical data
- Makes collections significantly faster - 2.5 minutes
## Our current in-clinic gait and function tests
- Test different functional tests with gait and markerless tracking in order to identify if the severity of OA and what the next steps would be
# Performance Side
## Athlete testing
- Force plates to measure explosive force
- Baselining performance and changes with training
- Track athletes data with the football/basketball team
- Assessing between limb-asymmetries for return to play following an injury
- Measuring the imbalance to better prepare and train them back to balance
### Marker less motion capture
- Assess mechanics, technique, and injury risk
## Motion capture out of lab
- Open-source marker less motion capture system
- developed at the mobilize center at Stanford university
## Innovations in kinesiology training
- Scientific computing and wearable technology (KINESIOL 4Z03)
- Notable projects
	- Head impact tracking
	- Sleep position sensor
	- Gait sonification
