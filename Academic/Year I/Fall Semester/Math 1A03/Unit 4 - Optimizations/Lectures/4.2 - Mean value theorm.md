# Rolle's Theorem
- If you start and end at the same value, the derivative of the function must be 0 at one point
![[Pasted image 20251003113539.png]]
## Theorem (rolle)
- If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $f$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$ and $f(a)=f(b)$ then there is some $c\in(a,b)$ such that $f'(c)=0$
## Caution
- 1) If $f$ is only continuous on the $(a,b)$ then Rolles may fail
![[Pasted image 20251003114042.png]]
- More generally, if $f$ is discontinuous at any point of $[a,b]$, then Rolles may fail

- 2) If $f$ is not differentiable at some point $c\in(a,b)$ then rolles may fail![[Pasted image 20251003114225.png]]
- 3) Need $f(a=f(b)$

- SHow at least one solution, the IVT
$$\begin{align}
 & f(0)=-1<0 \\
 & f(1)=1>0 \\
 \\
 & f\text{ is continuous on }[0,1] \implies \text{there is some c with 0<c<1 such that f(c)=0} \\ \\

 & \text{Show thtat there is at most one solution} \\
 & \text{assume there are at least two solution,} \\
 & \text{say a and b we may assume that a<b (else relabel)}  \\
 & \text{Since }f(a)=0=f(b)\text{ and }f\text{ is continuous on }[a,b]\text{ and differentiable on }(a,b)\text{,} \\
 & \text{we get by Rolle's theorem then some }c\in(a,b)\text{ will}f'(c)=0 \\
 \\
 & \text{But } f'(x)=\frac{d}{dx}(x^3+x-1) \\
 & =3x^2+1\geq 1>0 \\
 & \text{Contradiction}\implies\text{assumption that there are at least two roots is false}
\end{align}$$
# Mean Value Theorem

## Theorem (MVT)
$$\begin{align}
 & \text{If }f\text{ is continuous on }[a,b] \\
 & \text{and }f\text{ is differentiable on }(a,b) \\
 & \text{then there is some }c\in(a,b)\text{ such that} \\
 & f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
\end{align}$$
## Example
- Suppose I drive 25km in 30minutes, then there is some point in time where my instantaneous velocity is exactly 50km/h
## Caution: similar to rolle's theorem, both condition are necessary
- 1) $f$ needs to be continuous at endpoints too
![[Pasted image 20251003120201.png]]
- 2) $f$ needs to be differentiable on all of $(a,b)$
![[Pasted image 20251003120213.png]]
# Application of MVT
## Example
![[Pasted image 20251003120329.png]]
- Certainly there exists such a function with $f(4)=7$, Indeed $f(x)=2x-1$ satisfies the conditions
- Now let $f$ be an arbitrary function satisfying these conditions
- By MVT there exists some $c\in(1,4)$ such that
$$\begin{align}
 & f'(c)=\frac{f(4)-f(1)}{4-1} \\
\iff  & \underbrace{ 3\underbrace{ f'(c) }_{\leq 2 }+1 }_{ \leq 7 }=f(4) \\
\implies & f(4)\leq 7
\end{align}$$
