# Work
## Example
- Work done when lifting a 1.2 kg book 0.7m
$$\begin{align}
w & =F_{g}(0.7) \\
 & = 1.2(9.8)(0.7)
\end{align}$$
# Non-constant work
- If a variable force F(x) acts on an object travelling from a to b, then the work done by the force F is
$$\begin{align}
W=\int _{a}^bF(x)\,dx
\end{align}$$
- Example: A force of 40 N is required to hold a spring that has been stretched from its natural length of 10cm to a length of 15cm. How much work is done in stretching the spring from 15cm to 18cm

$$\begin{align}
40 & =k\cdot 0.05 \implies k =800  \\
\int 800x \,dx & = 800 \cdot \frac{x^2}{2} \Bigg|_{0.05}^{0.08}
\end{align}$$
# More non-constant work
- A tank has the shape of an inverted circular cone with height 10m and base radius 4m. It is filled with water to a height of 8m. Find the work required to empty the tank by pumping all of the water to the top of the tank. (The density of water is 1000 kg/m.)

$$\begin{align}
w_{x} & =F_{g,x} \cdot x \\
 & =m_{x} \cdot g \\
 & =v_{x}1000(9.8) \\
 & =\pi\left( \left( \frac{5}{2}10-x \right)^2\Delta x 1000(9.8)\right) \\
 \\
w & =\sum_{{i=1}}^n W_{i} \\
 & =\sum_{{i=1}}^n F_{i}\cdot x_{i} \\
 & =\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{25}{4}(10-x_{i})^2\Delta x 1000(9.8)\cdot x_{i} \\
 & =\sum_{i=1}^n \pi(160)\cdot (9.8) \cdot (10-x_{i})^2x_{i} \Delta x \\
\implies w & =\int_{2}^{10} \pi(160)(9.8)(10-x)^2x\,dx
\end{align}$$
