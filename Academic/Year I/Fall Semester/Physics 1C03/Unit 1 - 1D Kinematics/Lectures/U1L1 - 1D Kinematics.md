# Dimensions

- Physical Dimensions: An inherent and unvarying property for a given quantity

## Dimensional Analysis Rules
- 1. Terms on both sides of an equation must have the same dimensions
- 2. Log and exponential functions apply only to dimensionless quantities
- 3. Trig functions apply only to dimensionless quantities

### Example
E=mc^2
- Mass m has dimensions: Mass
- Velocity c has dimensions: Length/Time

- (MxL^2/S^2)=

$\Delta d=v_{i}\Delta t^2+\frac{1}{2}a\Delta t$
- x is a length
- v is a length/time
- a is a length/time^2
$$\begin{align}
(L) & =\left( \frac{L}{T} \right)T^2+\left( \frac{L}{T^2} \right)T \\
(L) & =(LT)+\left( \frac{L}{T} \right) \\
 & \therefore LS \text{ does not equal } RS
\end{align}$$
# Kinematics

## 1D Motion

Kinematics: The description of motion
One Dimension: Motion along a straight line

### Examples

There are three important functions of time to describe 1D motion
- $\vec{r}(t)$ is displacement from the origin
- $\vec{v}t$ is the rate of change in position
- $\vec{a}(t)$ rate of change in velocity

## Vector vs Scalars

- Scalar: Described by a real number with units
	- Time
	- Temperature
	- Distance
	- Speed
	- Always a plain typeface
- Vector: Described by both a scalar (magnitude) and a direction in space
	- Force
	- Velocity
	- Displacement
	- Always denoted with a $\vec{v}$
## Notation

- The unit vector $\vec{i}$ defines the axis
- Multiplying $\vec{i}$ by $b_{x}$ = +2.0m gives $\vec{b}$

## Displacement
![[Drawing 2025-09-04 10.02.27.excalidraw]]

- Displacement
- Represented by $\Delta x$
- $\Delta x = x_{f}-x_{i}$

## Vector Arithmetic

Magnitude: A scalar, is the length of a vector
- Vector Multiplication: Scalar x Vector = Vector

- Vector x Vector = ?
	- Cross or Dot product

- Vector + Vector = Vector
- Vector - Vector = Vector

## Average Velocity

Velocity: Time rate of change of position

- Plot position X as a function of time T
![[Drawing 2025-09-04 10.06.34.excalidraw]]
- Displacement: $\Delta x=x_{2}-x_{1}$
- Average velocity: $v_{av}=\frac{\Delta x}{t}$

## Instantaneous Velocity

![[Drawing 2025-09-04 10.10.13.excalidraw]]

$$t_{2} \to t_{1}, \Delta t \to 0 \text{ and } \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \to \frac{dx}{dt} = \vec{v}$$

## Instantaneous Acceleration

- Instantaneous acceleration is the average over an infinitesimal time interval

$$t_{2} \to t_{1}, \Delta t \to 0 \text{ and } \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \to \frac{dv}{dt} = \vec{v}$$
