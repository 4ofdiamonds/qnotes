## Describing Motion

- Motion Diagrams: Equal times between points![[Drawing 2025-09-08 09.36.20.excalidraw]]
- **Speeding up:** Acceleration and velocity vectors point in the same direction
- **Slowing down:** Acceleration and velocity vectors point in opposite directions
- Velocity is constant if and only if its acceleration is zero

## What do you think

$$\begin{align}
\vec{v}_{av} & =\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \\
\Delta x & =x_{2}-x_{1} \\
\end{align}$$

a) What is the total distance travelled by the object in the 5s interval
$$\begin{align}
\Delta x & =\int v dv\\
\Delta x & =3+3+2+1 \\
\Delta x & =9
\end{align}$$
b) What is the average velocity over the 5s interval
$$\begin{align}
v_{av} & =\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \\
v_{av} & =\frac{9}{5} \\
\end{align}$$
## Position, Velocity and Acceleration

- Specific features of any motion illustrated by shape and slope of graph
- We can determine the shape of the v-t graph from the x-t graph, the a-t graph from the v-t graph, and visa versa

$$\begin{align}
 & \vec{x}(t) \implies v(t)=\frac{dx(t)}{dt}\implies a(t)=\frac{dv(t)}{dt} \\
 & x(t)=x_{0}+\int_{0}^tv(t')dt' \impliedby v(t)=v_{0}+\int_{0}^ta(t')dt\impliedby a(t)
\end{align}$$
