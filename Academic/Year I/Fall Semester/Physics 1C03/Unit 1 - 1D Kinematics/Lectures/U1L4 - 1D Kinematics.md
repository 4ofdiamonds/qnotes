## Free Fall Objects
- Motion of an object moving under the influence of only gravity, and no other forces, is called free fall
	- The motion of the object can be in any direction
- All objects in free fall move with constant downward acceleration
$$\begin{align}
a & =g \approx 9.80 \frac{m}{s^2}[\text{downwards}]
\end{align}$$
- This was demonstrated by Galileo around 1600 A.D.
- “g” is called the “acceleration due to gravity” or the “gravitational field of the Earth”.
	- “g” itself is a positive quantity
- In free fall, acceleration is always directed downward
- If we take a as up direction then
$$\begin{align}
a & \to -g
\end{align}$$
- where g is a positive number =9.80m/s^2 on the surface of the earth

## Strategies - Handling Kinematic Equations

- You will often deal with multiple types of motion on problems: 
	- motion of objects can change
	- multiple objects can be moving
- KEY: Break up motion into different parts and for each part list displacement, initial and final velocity, acceleration and time
## Example

![[Pasted image 20250911100543.png]]

$$\begin{align}
\Delta d & =V_{i}\Delta t+\frac{1}{2}(a\Delta t^2) \\
2 & =15 t+\frac{1}{2}(-9.8t^2) \\
t & =3.18921
\end{align}$$
$$\begin{align}
v_{f}^2 & =v_{i}^2+2a\Delta d \\
v_{f} & =\sqrt{ 15^2+2(-9.8)(-2) } \\
v_{f} & =-16.254
\end{align}$$
