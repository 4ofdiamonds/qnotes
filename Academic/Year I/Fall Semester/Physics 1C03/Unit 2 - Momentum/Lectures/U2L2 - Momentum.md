## (Linear) Momentum
- Definition: The linear momentum P of a particle is its mass times its velocity
$$\begin{align}
\vec{p}\equiv m\vec{v}
\end{align}$$
- Momentum is a vector, snice velocity is a vector
- Units: $kg \frac{m}{s}$ (no special name)
## Velocity and Momentum
$$\begin{align}
\frac{m_{a}}{m_{b}} & =-\frac{\Delta v_{b}}{\Delta v_{a}} \\
m_{a}\Delta v_{a} & =-m_{b}\Delta v_{b} \\
\Delta p_{a} & =-\Delta p_{b}
\end{align}$$

## Momentum transfer
- Momentum is transferred through interactions between objects
$$\begin{align}
p_{1_{i}}+p_{2_{i}} & =p_{1_{f}}+p_{2_{f}} \\
p_{1_{i}}-p_{1_{f}} & =p_{2_{i}}+p_{2_{f}} \\
\Delta p_{1} & =-\Delta p_{2}
\end{align}$$

## Collisions with Friction
- Are the changes in the velocities of the carts caused by the collision still equal?
- Need to separate effect of friction from effect of collision

## Conservation of momentum
- Stated mathematically, the law of conservation of momentum for an isolated system is
$$\begin{align}
p_{f_{system}} & =p_{i_{system}} \\
p_{total} & =\sum p_{i} \implies\text{constant} \\
\Delta p_{system} & = 0
\end{align}$$
## Impulse
- Impulse is the change in momentum of an object:
$$\begin{align}
\Delta \vec{p} & =\vec{j}
\end{align}$$
## Types of collisions
- The total momentum of an isolated system is conserved regardless of the kind of collision that occurs
- Kinetic energy is sometimes conserved; it depends on the nature of the interaction force.
- A collision is call elastic if the total kine
