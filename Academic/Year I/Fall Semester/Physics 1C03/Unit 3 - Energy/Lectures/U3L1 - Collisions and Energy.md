- **B**: Momentum can still be conserved despite having inelastic collisions, but the collisions must be elastic and energy must be conserved in order to get the one to one ratio of ball bounces

- **C**: Momentum in the system is always conserved, but the change in momentum is different in the two scenarios
## Recap: Elastic Collisions
- One one dimension (all motion along the x-axis):
	- 1) Momentum is conserved: $$\begin{align}
m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}=m_{1}'v_{1}'+m_{2}'v_{2}'
\end{align}$$
- In one dimension, the velocities are represented by positive or negative numbers to indicate direction
	- 2) Kinetic Energy is conserved: $$\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2}m_{1}v_{1}^2+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}v_{2}^2=\frac{1}{2}m_{1}'v_{1}'^2+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}'v_{2}'^2
\end{align}$$
- Expressions for final velocities of carts 1 and 2
$$\begin{align}
v_{1}'=\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}v_{1}+\frac{2m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}v_{2} \\
v_{2}'=\frac{2m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}v_{1}+\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}v_{2}
\end{align}$$
## Inelastic Collisions
- In one dimension:
	- Momentum is conserved: $$\begin{align}
m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}=m_{1}'v_{2}'+m_{2}'v_{2}'
\end{align}$$
- In one dimension, the velocities are represented by positive or negative numbers to indicate direction
### Perfectly Inelastic Collisions
- Momentum is conserved: $$\begin{align}
m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_2 & =(m_{1}+m_{2})v' \\
v_{2}' & =\frac{m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}
\end{align}$$
## An elastic collision in slow motion
- Consider a collision between the following two carts. Cart 1 has a spring on the front of it. Note there is no friction.

- **B**: Kinetic Energy is not constant because it must be converted to potential energy before it accelerates the second cart

## Recall: 
$$\begin{align}
m_{s}=m \text{ and } m_{d}=2m \\
K_{i}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\
K_{s}'=\frac{1}{2}m\left( -\frac{1}{3} v\right)^2=\underbrace{ \frac{1}{2}mv^2 }_{ K_{i} }\left( \frac{1}{9} \right)=\frac{1}{9}k_{i} \\

\end{align}$$
## Applying the Elastic Collisions Equations
- Consider m2 is originally stationary
- What if m1
