## Kinetic Energy and Collisions

![[Pasted image 20250923103210.png]]
- Elastic collisions are reversible processes: There are no permanent changes in the state of colliding objects
- Inelastic collisions are irreversible processes: The changes that occur in the state of colliding objects cannot spontaneously undo themselves. The kinetic energy has gone into another type of energy which is irreversible
## Internal Energy
- **State**: The condition of an object completely specified by a set of parameters as shape and temperature
- **Process**: The transformation of a system from an initial state to a final state

## Closed Systems
- **Closed System**: one in which no energy is transferred to or from it
	- 1) Start with a sketch of the changes in state or motion during the time interval
	- 2) Identify all the changes in state or motion
	- 3) Choose a system that includes all the objects undergoing these changes in state or motion. Draw dashed lines around the objects in your chosen system boundary
	- 4) Verify that nothing in the surroundings of the system undergoes change in motion or state that its related to what happens inside the system
- **Inelastic Collision**: The amount of energy lost from the kinetic energy is equal to the amount of internal energy gained within the object
- Any collision: The energy of a system of two colliding objects does not change during the collision

## Kinetic Energy and Collision Types

## What do you think?

- **D**: The relative velocity between the mosquito between the dinosaur and the mosquito must be u, and since the dinosaur continues to travel at speed u, the velocity must increase to 2u to maintain that relative velocity
- 
## Elastic Collision - Relative Speed
- For elastic collisions, the relative speed is the same and before and after the collision: 
$$\begin{align}
|v_{1}-v_{2}|=|v_{1}'-v_{2}'|
\end{align}$$
- Special case: stationary target ($v_{2}'=0$)
	- Equal masses: If m1=m2, then v1f will be zero, particles exchange velocities
	- If m1<m2, then the incident particle recoils in the opposite direction
	- If m1>m2, then the particles will move forward after the collision

## Elastic Collisions - Stationary Target (v2i=0)
- Two limiting cases:
	- If m1<<m2, the incident particle rebounds with nearly its original speed
	- ![[Pasted image 20250923105848.png]]
	- 2) If m1>>m2, the target particle moves away with nearly twice the original speed of the incident particle
	- ![[Pasted image 20250923105944.png]]
## Coefficient of Restitution
$$\begin{align}
e=\Bigg| \frac{v_{2}'-v_{1}'}{v_{2}-v_{1}}\Bigg|
\end{align}$$
- The coefficient of restitution tells us what type of collision that we have. Tells us based of the ratio of the difference of relative velocities

## What kind of collision occurred?

![[Pasted image 20250923110357.png]]
- B) The change in velocity is the same which means that this must be a elastic collision and e=1
- D) The relative velocity is lower after the collision, which means that the numerator of the coefficient of restitution is smaller than denominator the implies that 0<e<1
## What do you think?

![[Pasted image 20250923110831.png]]
- D) Since the initial relative velocity is 0, that means that the equation is undefined and you could say that it is infinite
## Explosive Separation
- It is possible to have a process in which kinetic energy is gained at the expense of internal energy. This occurs when an object breaks apart
![[Pasted image 20250923111701.png]]
- Momentum is conserved, objects are initially at rest
$$\begin{align}
0=m_{1}'v_{1}'+m_{2}'v_{2}'
\end{align}$$
- Total energy is conserved
$$\begin{align}
\Delta K=\Delta E_{i}=\frac{1}{2}m_{2}v_{2}^2+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}v_{2}^+\Delta E=0
\end{align}$$
