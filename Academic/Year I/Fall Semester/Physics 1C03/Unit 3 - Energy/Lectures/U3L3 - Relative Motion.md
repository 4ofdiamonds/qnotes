# U3L3 - Relative Motion
# Taking up the Questions
## What did you find?

- Estimating the bouncing balls coefficient of restitution
$$\begin{align}
0<e<1\text{ inelastic} \\
\end{align}$$
- Analysis through energy
$$\begin{align} \\
 &  & \text{Analysis through Energy} \\
 &  & \cancel{ m }gh & =\frac{1}{2}\cancel{ m }v^2 \\
 &  & h & \propto v^2 \\
 &  & \text{Analysis through Kinematics} \\
 &  & v^2 & =v_{0}^2+2ah \\
  &  & \frac{h_{2}}{h_{1}} & =\left( \frac{v_{2}}{v_{1}} \right)^2 \\
 &  & \sqrt{ 0.75 } & = \frac{v_{2}}{v_{1}} \\
 &  &  & = 0.866 \\
 &  &  e  & = 0.866
\end{align}$$
## Class Question - Elastic Collision in Slow Motion

![[Pasted image 20250925094600.png]]
- a) $$\begin{align}
 & \text{Look at (i) to (m) -> looks like a perfectly inelastic collision -> momentum is conservered} \\
 & \vec{p}_{i}=\vec{p}_{f} \\
 & m_{1}v_{1} +m_{2}v_{2}=v(m_{1}+m_{2}) \\
\implies & v=4 \\
\end{align}$$
- b) 
$$\begin{align}
 & \text{Total mechanical energy is conserved} \\
 & K_{i}+\cancel{ S_{i} }=K_{f}+S_{f} \\
 & \frac{1}{2}m_{1}v_{1}^2+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}v_{2}^2=\frac{1}{2}(m_{1}+m_{2})v^2+\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\
\implies & x=0.1
\end{align}$$
# Centre of Mass
## Centre of Mass
- An object can be replaced by a point mass
- The point mass is located at the center of mass position
- Two particles on the x-axis; total mass, $M=m_{1}+m_{2}$
![[Pasted image 20250925095315.png]]
- The center of mass (CM) is defined as the location $$\begin{align}
x_{cm}=\frac{m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}}{M}
\end{align}$$
- The center of mass is an "average position" of the mass
## Centre of mass - Many particles
$$\begin{align}
r_{cm}=\frac{\sum m_{i}r_{i}}{\sum m_{i}}=\frac{\sum m_{i}r_{i}}{M} \\
\end{align}$$
- Recall the position vector, r has components x, y, and z in r3
### Symmetry
- The center of mass of any symmetric object lies on the axis of symmetry and on any place of symmetry
- For a uniform object, CM - center of geometry and mass is distributed evenly around this point
## Determining the Centre of Mass
- Define a coordinate system
- Identify the different parts of the system or different objects for which you know the mass and position with respsect to your coordinate system
- The position of centre of mass of the system
$$\begin{align}
x_{cm}=\frac{\sum m_{i}x_{i}}{\sum m_{i}}=\frac{\sum m_{i}x_{i}}{M} \\
y_{cm}=\frac{\sum m_{i}y_{i}}{\sum m_{i}}=\frac{\sum m_{i}y_{i}}{M} \\
\end{align}$$
![[Pasted image 20250925100005.png]]
## Velocity of the Centre of Mass
- Centre of mass: 
$$\begin{align}
 & mr_{cm}=\sum m_{i}r_{i} \\
 & \text{Differentiate with respect to time} \\
 & mv_{cm} =\sum m_{i}v_{i}=p_{total}
\end{align}$$
- The total momentum of any collection of particles is equal to the total mass ties the velocity of the CM point
## What do you think

![[Pasted image 20250925100728.png]]
$$\begin{align}
 & mv_{cm}=\sum m_{i}v_{i} \\
 & v_{cm}=\frac{m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}=\frac{mv_{0}+2m(0)}{3m} \\
  & v_{cm} =\frac{v_{0}}{3}
\end{align}$$
## Back to the class question
- What is the velocity of the centre of mass of the two-cart system before the collision, in the middle of the collision, and after the collision?
$$\begin{align}
\text{(i) } & v_{cm}=\frac{2(6)+4(3)}{6}=4\text{  m/s} \\ 
\text{(m) } & v_{cm}=4 \text{ m/s} \\

\text{(f) } & v_{cm}=\frac{2(2)+4(5)}{6}= 4\text{ m/s}
\end{align}$$
## Relative Motion
- The figure shows five frames of a film of two carts:
	- Part (a) show positions measured with ruler A, which is affixed to the earth reference frame
	- Part (b) shows positions measured with ruler B, which moves along with cart 2
![[Pasted image 20250925101724.png]]
- According to ruler A
	- The velocity of cart 1 is 0mm/frame
	- The velocity of cart 2 is 3.6mm/frame
- According to ruler B
	- The velocity of cart 1 is -3.6mm/frame
	- The velocity of cart 2 is 0mm/frame
