## 1D Relative Motion

![[Pasted image 20250929094119.png]]
- According to amy, carlos's velocity is: $v_{ac}=+5m/s$
- The subscript AC indicates C relative to A
- There is no true velocity, it is always measured from a certain observer
## Galilean Relativity

- Distance to event
	- in A: $\Delta x_{Ae}$
	- in B: $\Delta x_{Be}$
$$\begin{align}
 & \Delta x_{Ae}=\Delta x_{AB}+\Delta x_{Be} \\ \\

 & \text{Divide by time} \\

 & v_{ae}=v_{AB}+v_{Be} \\
 \\
\text{Take derivative wrt time} \\
 & \frac{d}{dt}(v_{ae}+v_{AB}+b_{Be}) \\
 & a_{Ae}=\underbrace{ a_{AB} }_{ \text{0 since v is contant} }+a_{Be} \\
 & a_{ae}=a_{be}  \\
 & \text{acceleration is the same in both intertia}
\end{align}$$

## Relative Motion Formlaism
- Suppose we have a stationary reference frame (axes x,y) and another reference frame x', y' moving at velocity v0. The relative displacement of the two sets of axes is r0 (which changes with time)
