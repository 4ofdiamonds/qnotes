$$\begin{align}
 & a=\frac{dv}{dt}\implies dv=adt \\
 & \frac{dv_{s}}{dv_{d}}=\frac{a_{s}dt}{a_{d}dt} \\
\implies & \frac{dv_{s}}{dv_{d}}=\frac{a_{s}}{a_{d}}=-2
\end{align}$$
## Effects of Interactions
- A ball bounces off a wall. Does the system violate conservation of energy during the interaction? $\implies$ No because the kinetic energy is transformed into potential energy

## What We Know: Effects of Interactions
- General Characteristics
	- Two objects are needed
	- The momentum of an isolated system of interacting objects is the same before, during and after the interaction
- For interactions that affect the motion of objects:
	- The ratio of x component of the accelerations of the interacting objects is the negative inverse ratio of their inertias
	- The systems kinetic energy changes during the interaction. Part of it is converted to (or from) some internal energy
## Potential Energy
- In any interaction part of the converted kinetic energy is temporarily stored as potential energy
- Potential energy is stored in a reversible changes in the configuration state
## Gravitational Potential Energy
- Where does the expression mgh come from?

$$\begin{align}
\Delta k & =k_{f}-k_{i} \\
 & =\frac{1}{2}mv_{f}^2-\frac{1}{2}mv_{i}^2 \\
 & =\frac{1}{2}m(\underbrace{ v_{f}^2-v_{i}^2 }_{ 2a\Delta d }) \\
 & =m(-g)(\Delta d) \\
 \\
\Delta k+\Delta u & =0 \text{ (conservation)} \\
\Delta k & =
\end{align}$$
## Potential Energy
- The gravitational potential energy depends only on the vertical heigh of the object above earths surface
- Uniform g: Ug=mgh
- Exact g: $U_{g}=\frac{-GMm}{r}$
