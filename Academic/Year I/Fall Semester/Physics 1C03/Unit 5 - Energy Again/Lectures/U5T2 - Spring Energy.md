## Mechanical Energy
- Is the sum of kinetic and potential energies
$$\begin{align}
E & =K+U \\
 & =K+U_{g}+U_{s}+\dots
\end{align}$$
## Potential Energy
- Internal, reversible energy in an object or system and can be converted to kinetic energy
## What do you think?
$$\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2}kx^2 & =mgh \\
\frac{1}{2}k\left( \frac{1}{4} x^2\right) & =mgh \\
\end{align}$$
## Energy Dissipation
- Kinetic energy which can not reappear is called dissipated energy
- **Coherent deformation**: Non permanent deformation which is reversible and will spontaneously return to its original shape
- **Incoherent deformation**: Permanent deformation which is not reversible

## Source Energy
- Source energy is an incoherent energy that is used to produce other forms of energy
## Possible Energy Conversions
- Interactions that cause reversible changes are non-dissipative; those that cause irreversible changes are dissipative

## Efficiency
$$\begin{align}
\text{efficiency}=\frac{\text{useful energy out}}{\text{useful energy in}}\times 100\%
\end{align}$$
## What do you think
$$\begin{align}
0=\frac{1}{2}kx^2+mgh \\
=\frac{1}{2}200h^2-20(h)
\end{align}$$
