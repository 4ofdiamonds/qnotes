## Think about it...
- Which of Newton's laws does a dog use to shake water from its fur? Explain
## Laws of Motion
- Newton’s first law of motion, first formulated by Galileo Galilei, is what we called the law of inertia in Chapter 6:
- In an inertial reference frame, any isolated object that is at rest remains at rest, and any isolated object that is in motion keeps moving at a constant velocity
## Laws of Motion
- We often see Newton's second law of motion written as$$\begin{align}
\vec{F}_{net}=\sum_{i}\vec{F}_{i}=m \vec{a}
\end{align}$$
- This is a vector sum of all forces that are acting on an object of mass, m
- The acceleration a is parallel to the net force, and proportional to it. The proportionality constant is the particle’s mass. Newton defines mass as a measure of an object’s inertia.
## Laws of Motion
- $\vec{F}_{net}=\sum \vec{F}$ is the net force. Again, this is the vector sum of all the forces acting on the object
## Laws of Motion
- We can express Newton's second law another way
$$\begin{align}
\sum \vec{F} & =m \vec{a} =m \frac{dv}{dv}=\frac{d(m \vec{v})}{dt}=\frac{dp}{dt}
\end{align}$$
- Net external force = rate of change of momentum
>[!Info] This is how Newton wrote the second law. It remains true in cases where the mass is not constant
- This is how a force is defined quantitatively: The force exerted on the object is the time rate of change in the object’s momentum
## Laws of Motion
- Newton’s third law of motion expresses the law of conservation of momentum in terms of forces
- Whenever two objects interact, they exert on each other forces that are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.
## What do you think?
- A 140-kg wrestler and a 90-kg wrestler try to push each other backwards out of the ring. At first they are motionless as they push; then the heavier wrestler moves the other one backwards. Compare the forces they exert on each other. Which statement is correct?
- A. The forces are always equal: this is because action reaction, the forces must be equal but because the other wrestler is lighter, the lighter wrestler moves easier
## Example: Throwing a ball
- Physics Girl throws a 0.1 kg ball vertically upward. The ball is in her hand for 0.5 s while being thrown and leaves her hand with a speed of 6.0 m/s. Estimate the average force exerted on the ball by Physics Girl
$$\begin{align}
v & =at \\
6 & =a 0.5 \\
a & =12 \\
 \\
f_{g}+f_{a} & = ma\\
-0.98+ f_{a} & = (0.1) 12\\
f_{a} & =\frac{0.1(12)+0.98}{0.1} \\
 & \boxed{ 2.18= f_{a} }

\end{align}$$
## What do you think?
- In the previous problem, the ball accelerated upward at 12 m/s2 while in the Physics Girl’s hand. 12 m/s2 is greater than 9.8 m/s2, the acceleration due to gravity. In order for the ball to accelerate upward, does the upward acceleration have to be greater than 9.8 m/s2?
- A: No the acceleration just has to be positive for the ball to move upward
