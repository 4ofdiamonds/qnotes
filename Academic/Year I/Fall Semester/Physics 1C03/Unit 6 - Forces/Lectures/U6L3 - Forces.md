## Passive Forces
- Passive forces can only be calculated as a response to other forces
- They will depend on the load it has to support and the acceleration they have to provide
- Passive forces are usually limited
## Translational Equilibrium
- A system not moving or moving at constant velocity is in translational equilibrium
	- For an object in translational equilibrium the force vectors add up to zero
	- However, as seen in the figure, forces can cause an object to rotate or to deform in addition to causing it to accelerate

- We will only consider the acceleration caused by forces: 
	- Whenever an object is at rest or moving at constant velocity, the vector sum of the forces exerted on the object is zero, and the object is said to be in equilibrium

## Friction
- Friction: force which resists the sliding of two surfaces across each other
- Statis Friction: 
	- There is no relative motion
	- fs prevents sliding
- Kinetic Friction: 
	- The block is sliding
	- fk is opposite to v

## Coefficients of Friction
- Define two pure numbers (unitless quantities)
	- 1. $\mu_{s} \to$ coefficient of static friction
	- 2. $\mu_{k} \to$ coefficient of kinetic friction
- Force of friction has the form
	- $f_{s}\leq \mu_{s}N$
	- $f_{k}=\mu_{k}N$
- $\vec{f}\neq\mu \vec{N}$ because the vectors are perpendicular to each other
## Coefficients of Friction
![[U6L3 - Forces-1761664083323.jpeg]]
- Values depend on smoothness, temperature, etc. and are approximate
- Usually μ < 1, but not always
- Usually, μk is less than μs, and never larger
- The coefficients depend on the materials, but not on the surface areas, contact pressure, et
## Friction
- An object does no slide as long as $f_{s}<f_{s,max}=\mu_{s}N$
- The object slips when $f_{s}=f_{s,max}$
- A statis friction force $f_{s}>f_{s,max}$ is not physically possible (use dynamic motion)
