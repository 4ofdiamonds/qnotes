- Momentum in a system can be changed by external forces
## What causes motion?
- Galileo: objects in uniform motion require no cause for their motion. Only changes in motion require a cause
- Newtonian dynamics: all influences on a particle from its surrounding expressed as forces exerted on that particle
## Types of forces: Fundamental Forces

## Types of forces: Gravity
- Attractive long range force between two objects
- In general: $$\begin{align}
F_{g}=-\frac{GMm}{r^2}
\end{align}$$
- Magnitude of weight is $|F_{g}|=mg$
- Note: 
	- i. "g" is always positive in this equation
	- ii. weight $\neq$ mass
	- iii. weight is measured in Newtons (N)
## Types of forces: Electromagnetic
- Responsible for the structure of atoms and molecules, for all chemical and biological process
- Electrostatic force: $$\begin{align}
F_{E}=\frac{kQq}{r^2}
\end{align}$$
- Magnetic force on moving charge: $$\begin{align}
F_{B}=qv \times B
\end{align}$$
## Types of forces: Normal Force
- Acts whenever the surfaces of two objects come in contact
- Acts perpendicular to contact surface
- If we look closely on the atomic level it is really just an elastic force
- All contact forces are result of electromagnetic forces

## Types of forces: Friction
- Acts when objects in contact
- Acts parallel to contact surface
- Acts opposite to direction motion
- Either static of kinetic

## Types of forces: Spring force
- Proportional to amount by which spring has been stretch or compressed and is a restoring force
$$\begin{align}
F_{\text{spring}}=-kd
\end{align}$$
- Where d is the amount that the spring has been stretched or compressed from its natural length

## Types of forces: Tension
- Pulling force with rope, cable, string, chain
- Always points away from object under consideration
- If the rope is very light, the tension is the same everywhere in it
- The tension is not changed if the rope passes over an ideal pully (frictionless and massless)

## Air Resistance/Drag, Buoyancy, and Lift
- Forces that occur in fluids
- Air resistance/drag: Friction between object and fluid, acts opposite to direction of motion, depend son speed of object as well as objects shape
- Buoyant force: upward force with magnitude equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaced
## Summary Types of forces: 
- Fundamental interactions: Gravity, Electromagnetic, weak nuclear, strong nuclear
- Macroscopic EM forces include: tension, spring, normal, friction, air resistance/drag, buoyant, lift
- Net force acting on an object is the sum of all the forces acting on the object
## Free-Body Diagrams - General Considerations
- Pick one object
- Identify all external forces which act directly on that body (gravity, contact, electromagnetic)
- Set up coordinate system
- May represent the CM of the object as a dot at the origin of the coordinate axes. It's also possible to use the rough shape of the object
- Draw each force acting on the object as a vector arrow (starting from the object pointing in the direction of the force)
- Draw the components of each force on the coordinate axes
- Indicate the direction of acceleration of the object beside the diagram
## FBD
- The the lab you must use the following notation for labelling forces: $F_{by,on}$, where
	- N=normal
	- T=tension
	- F$_{s}$=spring
	- w=gravitational
	- M=magnetic
	- $f_{s}$=static friction
	- $f_{k}$=kinetic friction
- Any contact force should be draw so that the tail of the vector touches the contact surface. Non contact force vectors can be drawn at the center of mass
