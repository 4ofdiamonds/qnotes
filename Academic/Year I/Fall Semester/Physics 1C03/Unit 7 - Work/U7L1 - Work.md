## Impulse Recap
- Impulse is the change in momentum
$$\begin{align}
J=\Delta p
\end{align}$$
- We can write Newton's 2nd law as
$$\begin{align}
F_{net}=\frac{dp}{dt}
\end{align}$$
- We can find the impulse as the area under a force vs time graph
## Work
- To describe these changes in energy, physicists, use the concept of work
- Work is the change in energy of a system due to external forces
- SI unit for work is J
$$\begin{align}
W & =F\cdot\Delta d \\
 & =F\Delta \sin \theta
\end{align}$$
## Work
- The total work done on a system to change its energy is
$$\begin{align}
W=\Delta E
\end{align}$$
- Work is a scalar quantity but can be positive or negative
## Positive and Negative Work
- The work done by a force on a system is positive when the force and the force displacement point in the same direction and negative when they point in opposite directions.
