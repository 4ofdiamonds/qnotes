## What do you think?
- Work is everything done externally on a system which can be determined by the addition of all the changes of energies in the system
- Ex. Gravity is external to the system when only the stone is considered to be in the system. Gravity is now work instead of energy
## Choosing a System
![[Untitled 9-1762440481353.jpeg]]
## Choosing a System - Friction consideration
- As seen in the figure below, the thermal energy generated ends up on both surfaces
- When drawing an energy diagram, do no choose a system for which friction occurs at the boundary of the system
## Choosing a System - Gravity
- We need to be careful not to double count gravitational potential energy
- Gravitational potential energy always refers to the relative positions of various parts within a system, never to the relative positions of one component of the system and its environment
- In other words, depending on the choice of system, the gravitational interaction with the system can appear in energy diagrams as either a change in gravitational potential energy or work done by Earth, but not both
- $W_{g}=-\Delta U_{g}$

## Work and Energy Problems
- A force act on an object. How much work is done?
- Simple situation:
	- A single constant force
	- A point object (rigid object, system of rigid objects)
	- No energy dissipation
- Building up...
	- Varying force 
	- Remove the restriction that there is only one force
	- Remove the restriction that the system is rigid
	- Allow for energy dissipation
## Work done by a single force

$$\begin{align}
w & =\Delta E=\Delta k+\cancel{ \Delta u }+\cancel{ \Delta E_{th} } \\

 & =m \frac{dv_{cm}}{dx_{cm}} \underbrace{ \frac{dx_{cm}}{dt} }_{ v_{cm} } \\

## What do you think?
- A physicist uses a spring cannon to shoot a ball at a stuffed gorilla. The cannon is loaded by compressing the spring 20 cm. The first 10 cm of compression requires work W. The work required to compress the spring the next 10 cm is
$$\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\
\frac{1}{2}k 10^2 =W \\
\frac{1}{2}k 20^2-\frac{1}{2}k 10^2 = W
\end{align}$$
$$\begin{align}
0 \to x_{0} & \implies W \\
x_{0} \to 2x_{0}  & \implies ? \\
 \\
w & =\int F \cdot dx \\
 & \text{for first 10cm} \\
w_{1} & =\int_{0}^{x_{0}} kx \,dx \\
 & =\frac{kx^2}{2}\Bigg|_{0}^{x_{0}} \\
 w_{1} & =\frac{1}{2}
\end{align}$$
