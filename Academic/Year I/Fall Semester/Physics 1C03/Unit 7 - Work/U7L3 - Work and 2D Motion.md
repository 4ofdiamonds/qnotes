## Work done by more than one force?

$$\begin{align}
W & =\Delta k+\Delta u+\Delta E_{t} \\
 & = \Delta k \\
F_{net} & =ma_{cm} \\
F_{1}-F_{2} & =ma_{cm} \\
w & =\int_{x_{i}}^{x_{f}}(F_{1} -F_{2})dx_{cm} \\
w & =\int_{x_{i}}^{x_{f}}F_{1} \,dx_{cm}-\int_{x_{i}}^{x_{f}}F_{2} \,dx_{cm}=w_{1}-w_{2} \\
\end{align}$$
## Work and Energy problems
- Notice the parallels between our treatment of momentum/impulse and energy/work

## What about a non-rigid system?
![[Work and 2D Motion-1762786227323.jpeg]]
$$\begin{align}
w & =\Delta k+\Delta u+\cancel{ \Delta E_{th} } \\
 & \text{Centre of mass} \\
F_{net} & =ma_{cm} \\
\Delta K_{cm} & =\int f_{net}\,dx_{cm} \\
 & \text{hdds true for all systems} \\
 \\
 & \text{Force displacement} \\
w & =\int_{x_{c,i}}^{x_{c,f}} F-dx_{f} \\
 & \text{If we have a constant force} \\
w & =F\underbrace{ \Delta x_{f} }_{ \text{large than }\Delta x_{cm} }
\end{align}$$
## Example
- A 1.0 kg cart and a 0.50 kg cart sit at different positions on a low-friction track. You push on the 1.0 kg cart with a constant 2.0 N force for 0.15 m. You then remove your hand and the cart slides 0.35 m and strikes the 0.50 kg cart.
	- a) What is the work done by you on the two-cart system
$$\begin{align}
w & =2(0.15) \\
 & =\boxed{ 0.3 }
\end{align}$$
	- b) What is the velocity of the 1 kg cart just before it strikes the 0.5kg cart?
$$\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2}mv^2 & =0.3 \\
\frac{1}{2}(v^2) & =0.3 \\
v & =\sqrt{ 0.6 } \\
 & =\boxed{ 0.774 }
\end{align}$$
	- c) How far does the system's center of mass move while you are pushing the cart?
$$\begin{align}
x_{cm} & =\frac{m\Delta x_{1}+m\Delta x_{2}}{m} \\
 & = \frac{1(0.15)+0.5(0)}{1.5} \\
 & = \frac{0.15}{1.5} \\
 & =\boxed{ 0.1m }
\end{align}$$
	- d) By what amount does your force change the kinetic change of the system's center of mass?
$$\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2}mv_{cm}^2 & =0.3 \\
\frac{1}{2}1.5v_{cm}^2 & =0.3 \\
v & = \sqrt{ \frac{0.6}{1.5} } \\
 & =\boxed{ 0.632 }
\end{align}$$
## What about a dissipative force? 
- How do we handle sliding friction?
	- The frictional force is dissipative and so causes a change in thermal energy. This force is also a distributed force because there is no single point of application
$$\begin{align}
\Delta E & =\Delta k+\Delta u+\Delta E_{th}=0 \implies \Delta E_{th}=-\Delta k=-(k_{f}-k_{i}=k_{i}) \\
 \\
\Delta K_{cm} & =-\int_{x_{cm,i}}^{x_{cm,f}}f_{k}\,dx_{cm}=-f_{k}\Delta x_{cm}
\end{align}$$
## Dissipative Forces? 
- As two objects slide against each other, atomic interaction at the boundary transform the kinetic energy k macro into thermal energy in both objects
