- Since work is a scalar quantity, which means that you add up the work on all 4 sides

- The force and the displacement have to be going in the same direction, but you can resolve the forces either way

- They both do the same because it is the same gravitational potential energy

## Conservative and Non-Conservative Forces

- a) conservative forces are associated with potential energy: gravity, spring
- b) non-conservative: tension, normal, friction
- c) 
## Conservative and Non-conservative Forces
### Conservative
- Gravity
- Spring Force
- The work done by a conservative force on a particle is independent of the path
- We can associate a potential energy for a system with any conservative force acting between members of the system
### Non-conservative forces
- Friction
- Drag forces
- The work done by a non-conservative force on a particle is non independent of the path
