Hello everyone these are my notes from Grade 12-First Year at McMaster (will be updated frequently)

## General
- To access my notes from McMaster go to [[Year I]] to access all my year one notes or you can just go to the file explorer on the top left and open Academics>Year I>Fall Semester>Whichever course
- Each course is organized in units folders and each unit folder will have lectures, labs, tutorials, and case studies. The files will be named with: 
	- T=theme or tutorial
	- M=module
	- L=lecture or lab
	- CS=case study
	- A or R at the end to indicate either applied or review lecture
- For example T1L1R means "Theme 1 Lecture 1 Review" or M5 means "Module 5"
## Math Specific
- My math notes are currently unsupported but I will try to find a fix soon
