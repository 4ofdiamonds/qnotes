## Impact of Nutrition Policies (and Diets) on Population Health
- Food Supply
- Consumer Awareness: food purchasing
- Risk Factor Surveillance: health
## Food fortification in Canada
- Defined as adding micronutrients to food
## Characterizing supplemented foods in Canada
- The highest added RDA is niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C
## But who consumes SFs?
## The Canadian health measures survey
- What is is?
	- A national population health study that collects real physical and lab measures
- What's measured?
	- Heights, weights, blood pressure, blood tests, frequency questionnaire, and 7 day movement data using activity monitors
## Proportion of Supplemented Food Consumers
- A lot of the population has consumed vitamin water or sports drinks (1/3)
## Who is consuming these drinks?
- Even people who are less physically active are drinking sports drinks
- Men drink more than women
- On the chart that shows probability of drinking, if the confidence interval touches one it is insignificant
- They found the most likely are young men who consume alcohol
## Testing the consumer pact of proposed labelling of supplemented foods
- She proposed to add a new nutritional label that would give an official supplemented seal, what nutrients are supplemented, and who should be consuming them
## What is nutrition literacy
- The ability to find, understand and use nutrition information to make everyday food and health decisions
- Goes beyond reading - about interpreting label, portion size and health claims
- Influence's how people eat and shop
- Key part in health literacy and is linked with education and socioeconomic factors
## What measure nutrition literacy?
- It is very important especially because people who are marginalized have a harder time
## They tested consumer impact of proposed labelling for supplemented food
- They asked questions and saw how much more they could tell about the food from the label
- They figured out a supplemented food facts label
## Ongoing research
- Examine food supply response of updated regulations
- What is consumer exposure to do all supplemented foods in Canada
## Policy efforts to improve diet quality
- Labelling high fat and unhealthy food
- Limit marketing to children on unhealthy foods
- Limit ultra-processed foods
## Ultra-Processed Foods
- Defined as anything that are not whole foods and use terms that the consumer may not recognize
- made of additives and flavorings
## Processed Food Marketing
- Regulated labels exist which make claims
- Unregulated labels are not allowed to be misleading but the line is often very blurry
## Processed food intakes in Canada
- Most peoples diets are made of 50% ultra processed foods
## Ultra-processed foods and cardiometabolic risk
- Who consume UPF
	- Males
	- Low income
	- Black or White
	- Less education
	- TV
	- smokers
	- people who eat more food
	- people who eat less veggies
## Analysis
- Their exposure variable was compared against other factors like BMI, (etc), glucose
- More 
- Higher triglyceride
- Higher insulin
- Higher BMI
- Higher white blood cells -> shows inflammation inside the body
- Higher C reactive proteins

- These findings were published on the CBC and was found in 35 other news sources

## Cross-sectional vs Longitudinal studies
- Tracking at an instantaneous moment vs over time
